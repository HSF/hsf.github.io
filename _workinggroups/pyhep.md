The PyHEP working group brings together a community of developers and users of Python in Particle Physics, with the aim of improving
the sharing of knowledge and expertise. It embraces the broad community, from HEP to the Astroparticle and Intensity Frontier communities.

The group is currently coordinated by Chris Tunnell (XENON1T), Eduardo Rodrigues (LHCb) and Jim Pivarski (CMS),
who took over from Graeme Stewart (CERN EP-SF) in January 2019.
All coordinators can be reached via <hsf-pyhep-organisation@googlegroups.com>.

# Getting Involved

Everyone is welcome to join the community and participate by means of the following:

* [Gitter channel PyHEP](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP){:target="_pyhep_gitter_channel} for any informal exchanges.
* [GitHub repository of resources](https://github.com/hsf-training/PyHEP-resources){:target="_pyhep_resources_repo"},
  e.g., Python libraries of interest to Particle Physics.

# PyHEP Series of Workshops

The **PyHEP workshops** are a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HSF
with the aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.

## PyHEP 2018

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, was held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/). It focused on a review of where and how Python is used in our community, and what the future will hold.
The workshop was a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper](/activities/cwp.html). There was ample time for discussion.

A keynote presentation on [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/){:target="_pyhep2018_jupyterlab"}
was given by [Vidar Tonaas Fauske](https://www.simula.no/people/vidar){:target="_pyhep2018_vidar"}.

The [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/694818/){:target="_pyhep2018_indico"} was composed of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:

1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 and 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

There were no training sessions nor hackathons in this first workshop,
but some level of tuition came in small bites in the various presentations,
which tried to be educative, not just informative, with well-defined examples relevant to the topics under discussion.
One of the goals of this PyHEP workshop was the identification of training workshops or hackathons the community would like to have in the future.
