Hola! I'm Michel Hernandez Villanueva. I'm a researcher at Brookhaven National Laboratory, working on the [Belle II](https://belle2.jp) experiment.
My main interests are flavor physics with tau leptons, analysis on distributed computing environments, training, and outreach.
A software and computing problem I’m grappling with is the scalability of the Belle II analysis workflow in the high-luminosity scenario.

I joined the HSF Training group in 2020. I’ve got my eyes on the sustainable operation of the grid, training newcomers, and getting fresh ideas!
My motivation is to explore together advanced tools. I want to know more about machine learning pipelines, and their potential usage in the High Energy Physics experiments.
