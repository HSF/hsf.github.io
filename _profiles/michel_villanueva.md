Hola! I'm Michel Hernandez Villanueva. I'm a research fellow at DESY, working in the [Belle II](https://belle2.jp) experiment.
My main interests are flavor physics with tau leptons, analysis on distributed computing environments, training, and outreach.

I joined the HSF Training group in 2020. My motivation is to explore together advanced tools, popular within the HPC
community, and their potential usage in the High Energy Physics workflow.
