Hello everyone! I am a Ph.D. student at Duke University tackling questions regarding Holobiont Ecology and Evolution. My main project is trying to disentangle how biotic
and abiotic factors are shaping the metabolic and taxonomic diversity of the liche
holobiont. I love art in all its expressions, I enjoy a lot listen to Debussy, the
paintings of Hokusai, and anime. I love to try to share with people what I have
learned until now and create collaborations.
