Giordon Stark is a Deaf, post-doctoral, experimental particle physicist involved with the ATLAS collaboration looking for signs of new physics Beyond the Standard Model. He cares about boosted object reconstruction, hadronic final states, jet substructure, pile-up mitigation techniques, the intersection of particle physics & machine learning, and more! When he's not busy hacking together python, he can be found in the kitchen baking sweets and breads.
