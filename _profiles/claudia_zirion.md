I am Claudia (she/her), a Mexican Biologist and a Carpentries Instructor. During my undergrad studies at Facultad de Ciencias and Instituto de Fisiología Celular, UNAM, I worked on Fungal Cell Biology. And during my master's at Langebio, Cinvestav, I studied Bacterial Ecology and Evolution. What I love the most about Biology is sharing it through teaching and science communication. I like learning bioinformatics and finding the best ways of helping others to enjoy it.
