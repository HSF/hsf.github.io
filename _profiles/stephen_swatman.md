Hi there, I'm Stephen! I'm currently a PhD student at the University of
Amsterdam. The twist is that I am actually a computer scientists masquerading
as a physicist. After a little over a year, I am worried they might be starting
to suspect something... Anyhow, I mainly work on high performance computing,
and my research consists of bringing high energy physics workloads to GPGPUs
and other massively parallel heterogeneous devices. I am also interested in
programming language theory, compiler construction, and functional programming.
I enjoy teaching a lot, and I hope that I can impart some useful knowledge
about computing through the HSF!
