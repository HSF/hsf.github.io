Hello World ! I am a french scientific software engineer, born with the object paradigm, now moving towards the functional one. I practice mostly C++ (and a little Python). I am currently involved in few projects for portable and durable parallel software in High Energy Physics (SYCL). I have been teaching C++ for the past 20 years.
