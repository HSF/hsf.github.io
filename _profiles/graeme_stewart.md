Hi! I'm Graeme and I have been involved in the HSF since the very early days. I
am also a member of the [ATLAS collaboration](https://atlas.cern/). I am
currently one of the main HSF Coordinators, so I try to look after a bit of
everything, but I try and focus my creative and development time on helping with
the use of the Julia language in HEP, through
[JuliaHEP](http://www.juliahep.org.). I work on research software quality and
software sustainability in the [EVERSE](https://everse.software) project.

I am a strong supporter of efforts to increase diversity in HEP and science.

In case you are wondering about my avatar, my daughter drew the cat picture for me (thanks Eilish!).
