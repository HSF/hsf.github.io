Hello,
 I'm Sakib. My PhD thesis was based on simulation and data analysis for parity-violating electron scattering experiments (PREX-2/CREX and MOLLER) at Jefferson Lab, USA. I am currently working as a first year postdoc at University of Manitoba on AI-driven detector design and track reconstruction software for the EPIC experiment that will take place at the future EIC (Electron-Ion Collider) facility. I like learning and teaching software skills relevant to high-energy physics. I am best reachable through my linkedin profile or email.
