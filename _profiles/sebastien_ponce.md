I'm a member of the computing group of the LHCb experiment, based at CERN.
I'm specialized in large software optimizations, especially using the C++ language.
I've been given C++ and optimization courses for years, in particular within LHCb, at the CERN school of computing and at ESIPAP (European Scholle for Instrumentation in Particle and AstroPhysics).
