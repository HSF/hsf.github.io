# Community White Paper (CWP) 

This page gives more detail about the process that gave rise
to the HSF's [Community White Paper Roadmap](../activities/cwp.html)
for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s.

It is kept for historical interest and to preserve intermediate documents
about exercise.

## A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments 
over the next 10 years requires the HEP community to address a number of 
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that
the computing models will need to evolve and a significant "software 
upgrade" is required.
In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development 
investments required, we embarked on a community planning process. The 
aim
was to produce a Community White Paper 
(CWP) which would describe the community strategy and a roadmap for 
software and computing R&D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity was organised under 
the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF were 
specifically [charged by the WLCG project]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf) and
reached out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.

## Final Roadmap Paper

The [final version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982){:target="_cwp_roadmap_arxiv"}
of the CWP Roadmap was submitted to arXiv on 15 December 2017.
It was accepted on 18 December.

**The roadmap can still be endorsed by the community** and minor updates will be done
to expand the author list and or to correct any errors found. Please contact the 
[CWP Ghost Writers](mailto:hsf-cwp-ghost-writers@googlegroups.com?subject=CWP Signature).
*We very much encourage you to do this, to show the breadth of the community's support
for the roadmap.*

The second draft of the CWP, the 
[Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RIcnj7DBNOoQ1DT45WCGFboS0tCDeJcvAi2xjPv_UVQ){:target="_cwp_roadmap"} 
report (also available as a 
[pdf]({{site.baseurl}}/CWP/papers/roadmap/HSF-Community-White-Paper-v0.2.pdf))
was released to the community on November 17.

The first draft was released on October 20, it is still available as a
[Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rcPIJQc3LNAh5tjHKjfuq80StrMO5ksiLwhDlJzeg9U/edit?usp=sharing){:target="_cwp_roadmap"} 
or as a [PDF]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/HSF-Community-White-Paper-v0.1-linenumbers.pdf).

## CWP Process

The CWP process involved a number of workshops between January and Summer 2017. As part of the process members of the community were encouraged to write white papers to describe their ideas on the various topics. White papers could be submitted by anyone: individuals, groups of individuals, experiments, institutions, etc.

There is a [list of the contributed CWP whitepapers](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp-whitepapers.html).

Some guidance and suggestions for WGs was orignally given here: [Guidance for WGs at HSF workshop at SDSC](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-wg-guidance-sdsc.html)
