title: Creating a HSF module from scratch
layout: plain
---

If...

* you want to create a new carpentry-style training lesson from scratch (or from material that is in another format)
* you have talked to us about it

then this is for you!

Creating the repository and getting started
-------------------------------------------

**We recommend you to let us do this part, so that you can start with the content right away!**

Simply follow the instructions in our [cookiecutter repository](https://github.com/hsf-training/carpentry-cookiecutter).

Resources
----------
Here are a few links to keep handy that can be helpful when building your module
  - [Our CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/carpentries/lesson-example/blob/gh-pages/CONTRIBUTING.md)
  - [SWC Github flow](https://github.com/dmgt/swc_github_flow/blob/master/for_novice_contributors.md)

Filling in content
------------------

After the last section, you should have repository that creates a blank carpentry style lesson.

* Follow the "Jekyll Setup for Lesson Development" instructions of the [carpentry tutorial setup instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/setup.html).
* If you are interested to study the pedagogical concepts behind the carpentries approach, head [to their handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/)
* [The technological section of their handbook](https://carpentries.github.io/curriculum-development/technological-introductions.html) is a good starting point to create content right away
* The [tutorial on creating content](https://carpentries.github.io/lesson-example/02-tooling/index.html) also gives a nice introduction (but perhaps a bit more from a technological standpoint)

What to not edit
----------------

* If you improve the HSF style and other general parts of the page, please commit your changes to the HSF style repository and then pull your changes from there (this way, all other modules benefit from the changes as well)

FAQ

> This is so much to take in, I feel entirely overwhelmed and discouraged.

This is entirely normal, if you're new to the technology stack that we're using (Markdown, Jekyll, git, github, ...). But don't despair, we're here to help you! Simply [write to us](mailto:hsf-training-wg@googlegroups.com) or [join our weekly meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10294/), or join the [Mattermost educators space](https://mattermost.web.cern.ch/signup_user_complete/?id=t9zkdocffbbozqcdy193myre8y) and we'll help you get unstuck. We can also arrange a short meeting where we share screens and figure out problems.
