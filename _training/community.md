To fulfill our mission, we rely on active community members to support us in various ways.

We would like to thank everyone for their time, energy and dedication!

If you contributed to HSF training, but don't find yourself in the list below (or spot some outdated information), see [this page](/training/howto-educator-profile.html) for how to fix this. 
See [here](/training/educators.html) for a special thank you for everyone who made our workshops possible.
