We will hold a mini-workshop event on the topic of “Software Citation and Recognition in HEP”, which will take place virtually over two 1/2 days on November 22-23, 2022.

This meeting will foster a community discussion around ways in which HEP experiments can best handle the citation of software and recognition for software efforts that enable physics results disseminated to the public.

This meeting is jointly organized by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) and the Institute for Research and Innovation for Software in High-Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP).
