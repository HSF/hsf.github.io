We are pleased to hold a mini-workshop event on the topic of “Software Citation and Recognition in HEP”, which will be held virtually over two 1/2 days on November 22-23, 2022.

This meeting aims to provide a community discussion around ways in which HEP experiments handle citation of software and recognition for software efforts that enable physics results disseminated to the public.

This meeting is jointly organized by the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) and the Institute for Research and Innovation for Software in High-Energy Physics (IRIS-HEP).
