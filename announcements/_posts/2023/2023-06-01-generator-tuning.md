HSF Event Generator Tuning Workshop

Tuning plays a critical role in ensuring that the output of event generators best matches experimental data. However, tuning an event generator can be a complex task, as it requires a good understanding of the event generators, what data to use in tune, and the tools used to perform the tune itself. This workshop aims to bring together tuning tool experts as well as event generator experts to provide tutorials over two half days. The first day of the workshop will focus how event generator parameters can modify physics observables, while the second day will focus on the tuning tools.
