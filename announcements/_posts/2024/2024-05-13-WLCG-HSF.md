We are delighted to announce that the joint WLCG-HSF workshop will take place at DESY, Hamburg from 13-17 May 2024. Registration is already open, and you can find a lot of information already on indico:

<https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf-2024/>

where you are encouraged to register as soon as possible, as well as book your accommodation in Hamburg.

There will be many important sessions discussing the computing and software systems that are needed in HEP, to tackle the challenges of future accelerators and experiments. There will be dedicated sessions on Analysis Facilities, Data Challenges, WLCG and HSF evolution, and Training. (The full session timetable will be published soon.)

The HSF will have a special focus at this workshop on **Community Software**, where you can describe a tool, package or other contribution that you are making to software for multiple HEP experiments. Submissions describing projects or other ideas, such as training initiatives or community support structures are also warmly welcomed. [Abstract submission](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/abstracts/) for this HSF session is also open now.

We very much look forward to seeing you in Hamburg in May!
