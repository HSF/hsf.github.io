# List of URL to ignore in html-proofer external link check
# One URL per line, comments allowed as a full line or after the URL.
# There is only a limited support for URL regexp rather than plain
# URL : use a regexp only if it is really necessary. But the URL
# may be a partial URL (ommitting the protocol for example or the
# end of the URL).
#
# Please, DO NOT PUT BROKEN URLs in this file. Only add URLs that
# cannot be verified successfully by html-proofer despite you
# validated them with a browser.
