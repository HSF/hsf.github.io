# How to get involved

Our goal is to make every effort going on as transparent and open as possible. Our official communication channel is the hep-sf-forum. Simply send a mail with ‘subscribe’ as the subject (not content) to hep-sf-forum+subscribe@googlegroups.com

In addition, there is a HEP S&C community mailing list for occasional HEP software and computing community mailings. Everyone involved or interested in HEP S&C is encouraged to sign up to this list. It will be used for occasional mailings of community wide interest, such as announcements of HEP S&C conferences, workshops and schools.

# Areas for contribution 

There are plenty of opportunities for you to contribute to the HSF, be it by participation in technical discussions, by joining one of our working groups, or by joining the HSF with your software project:

  *  Particpation in HSF activities and fora. See the Activities page.
  *  Participation in HSF events and meetings. 
  *  Taking advantage for your project from the HSF (to be created)
  *  Giving input to the HSF startup team
  *  Contributing to this website

# Meetings

See the Events listing on this site for information on HSF meetings, workshops, etc. Meetings use CERN indico for agenda pages. The pages are open to the world, no CERN account needed. So is Vidyo, the conference system we use. Connection info is on the indico pages. However should you need to upload material to the agenda, a CERN account is needed. CERN provides lightweight accounts to non CERN affiliated people when needed. See https://account.cern.ch/account/Externals/

# Giving input to the HSF

In this document we provide background information, guidelines and a questionnaire for giving input to the HSF, and as background to discussions with the HSF startup team. We'd love to hear from you. If you'd like to arrange a discussion, contact any member of the startup team or email the startup team at hep-sf-startup-team@googlegroups.com.

This page provides information on adding material to the site. It is visible to those with an editor role, which is pretty much everybody with an approved account. Information on adding content is below. To modify existing content, use the 'edit' tab you find on each content page. Questions are welcome, direct them to Torre Wenaus, wenaus@gmail.com.

# Contributing to the HSF Knowledge Base

The HSF provides a S&C knowledge base cataloging software in use by the community, who uses it, etc. For an introduction to the knowledge base, see the presentation on it at the SLAC workshop. The knowledge base relies on community input if it is to become comprehensive and useful. Please add, update, elaborate, correct entries for your favorite software packages, experiments, etc. All are welcome and encouraged to add and edit material.
