<h2 id="project-support-in-hsf-mon-am">Project support in HSF (Mon am)</h2>

<p>HSF is about SW: project support an important goal</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Good practices and appropriate tools can help sharing SW</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Plenty of things to consider, often forgotten or postponed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A list of best practices have been drafted</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>On GitHub as everything done by HSF (documents repository)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Feedback is more than welcome!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>License is one of the critical topic: HSF Technical Note available to help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Importance of documenting contribution workflow to get contributors</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Recommendations are not HEP specific which is as it should be</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ensure there aren’t hidden dependencies like assumptions on afs or cvmfs presence</li>
</ul>

<p>A template is available for new projects: hsf_create_project.py</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Build a CMake project</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Configure build, tests, packaging, install: some technologies chosen among the possible ones</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Created files with detailed documentation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Genesis of the starter template was a real project stripped down to its essentials</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Test resources: plenty of resources available (for free) for continuous integration</p>

<ul>
  <li>In addition CERN proposed access to TechLab for specific, fancy HW. FNAL ready to do the same…</li>
</ul>

<p>Define a set of standards to be met to be accepted as an HSF packages?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Checklist is a good start</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Should not be exclusive or prescriptive, point is to give guidelines</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Oriented towards standalone projects. Another aspect is a project that needs to build against a number of other large pieces, and adds incremental functionality. Define standard ways of interfacing to existing projects.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ROOT, for example.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If project is cmake based, have a set of tools to interface to any other cmake based package</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A point of the packaging WG is to define a canonical stack to enable projects following guidelines to work together</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s an objective of the spack code sprint tomorrow</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set things up so that “if you use ROOT, just uncomment this line” etc</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>HSF objectives remembered: share expertize, raise awareness around projects, make easier for people to start new projects…</p>

<p>HSF concrete work organized in 6 WGs: information exchange, training, SW packaging, SW licensing, SW projects, dev tools and services</p>

<p>Communication: web, mailing list/fora, knowledge base, technical notes</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Topical forums: SW Technology (former Concurrency Forum), Reconstruction Algorithms, Machine Learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KB: emphasize easy adding/editing of contents, cross-linking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TN: anything useful that you want to share, already 4 available</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Training: focus on sharing training material</p>

<ul>
  <li>Important focus on WikiToLearn, a wiki-based platform to make this easier. WikiToLearn objective: make possible for students/trainees to improve the material. Contents is what you contribute!</li>
</ul>

<p>SW Packaging: see this morning and tomorrow’s hackathon</p>

<ul>
  <li>Work so far summarized in a TN</li>
</ul>

<p>Licensing: guidelines summarized in a TN</p>

<ul>
  <li>Second version planned based on your feedback</li>
</ul>

<p>SW projects: see this morning too</p>

<p>HSF is also about fostering collaboration around SW: some successes in the last year (Next-generation Conditions DB, Track reconstruction, Gaudi</p>

<ul>
  <li>Some satellite projects like DIANA (4-year NSF funded), AIDA2020) taking care of being coordinated with HSF</li>
</ul>

<p>Food for thoughts during the workshop: to be discussed on Wednesday</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>HSF need a logo: vote for your preferred logo!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project reviews: recently asked by GeantV as a first candidate. Review as an open process but report and conclusions by the review committee. Other interested project should contact HSF.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HSF StackExchange? A complement/alternative to forums. Overlap with other tools like RootTalk?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HSF Journal: publish S&amp;C papers in peer-reviewed journals. May be good for larger visibility across communities, may help with career recognition. Springer ready to collaborate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HSF need more decicated resources/people: required to achieve our goals, needs to be funded. Endorsement from ICFA or similar bodies?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HSF as a legal entity: currently not a foundation! May help with IPR/copyright handling, facilitate collaboration with industry… Also cons… discuss during the workshop,try to agree on a plan on Wednesday</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Discussion</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Conda missing from packaging tools report? Didn’t have a Conda advocate in the group, though it was presented. Document was in circulation for comment for weeks, could have had input at any time. Did try to do some Conda follow-up and didn’t find volunteers. Can still welcome a revision that includes Conda properly. Could do it in this workshop.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In seeking resources by ‘HSF resources’ we do not mean HSF owned resources. We mean people identified and assigned with a fraction of their time to work through HSF projects. E.g. someone working on re-engineering tracking, work on that through the HSF to make the effort common as much as possible.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="community-white-paper---peter-elmer">Community white paper - Peter Elmer</h3>

<p>HSF demonstrated some initial collaborative activities but to address the challenges ahead of us (e.g. HL-LHC) we need more and dedicated resources</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>2 projects recently funded, DIANA (NSF) and AIDA2020 WP3 (EU): not started as part of HSF but they are examples of projects which will contribute to the overall HSF effort</p>

<h3 id="future-conditions-db---andrea-formica">Future conditions DB - Andrea Formica</h3>

<p>Conditions data are used at different stages of our workflows and are also refined during these stages (online processing, prompt reconstruction, bulk processing, …)</p>

<p>CMS developed during LS1 a new schema trying to simplify what was done in Run 1: this schema is in production in Run 2</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>ATLAS expressed interest: matching its own ideas of useful metadata after Run 1 experience</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Condition data as Blobs: storage system not aware about the internal structure. Metadata in the tag table provides the necessary information to deserialize the object.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>CMS chose Boost library for the serialization: several others choices possible (Google Protobuf, HDF5, ROOT or ascii formats like JSON and XML)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
</ul>

<p>Architecture requirement: decouple clients from backend using a REST API, support many different kinds of backends including several relational platforms (Oracle, PostgreSQL,…), but eventually also NoSQL or file system. All business code to manage the conditions data is inside a server. The clients can be implemented in several languages because the communication is done via HTTP using JSON for the messages exchanged with the server.</p>

<p>Current prototype implemented in Java (based on JEE, Spring): easier integration into Frontier, the idea being to profit at most of the experience gained by the Frontier development group in terms of caching etc….</p>

<p>Client implementation for the moment on going. For python easy via automatic generation of client API based on swagger documentation.</p>

<p>Motivations, potential: see slides</p>

<ul>
  <li>Very successful use in the context of LArTPC</li>
</ul>

<p>GPUs critical for performance</p>

<p>Need to provision a large amount of resources: no longer embarassingly //</p>

<p>DL in reconstruction: will require distribution of large datasets for training DNN</p>

<ul>
  <li>Will require available of public dataset: also required to communicate with DL experts</li>
</ul>

<p>Proposal of a R&amp;D project consisting to build a HEP framework on top of DL</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use Google TensorFlow framework to the DL part (open-source)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Success would mean HEP science is closer to other sciences: would benefit from more experts and offer a greater potential for collaboration with Data Scientists (and industry)</p>

<h3 id="openlab-ml-and-data-analytics-workshop---m-girone">OpenLab ML and Data Analytics Workshop - M. Girone</h3>

<p><a href="https://github.com/CERN" class="user-mention">@CERN</a>, April 29, <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/514434/timetable/"><em>https://indico.cern.ch/event/514434/timetable/#20160429.detailed</em></a></p>

<p>A lot of investment in industry: interesting contributions by several companies. Many good reasons to collaborate but must also take into account the different culture regarding collaboration. OpenLab and its NDAs infrastructure can help.</p>

<p>Event classification: interest by LHCb and ALICE to meet the Run3 challenges, CMS also has plans</p>

<p>Object identification: great potential, raised by all experiments. Could benefit from industry experience with image recognition (self-driving cars…) if we could formulate the problem in a similar way…</p>

<p>Anomaly detection: a growing use case in the industry (e.g. security), may be relevant to HEP</p>

<p>Data analysis: all experiments with plan to have events almost ready for analysis when the leave the detector (online reconstruction for ALICE and LHCb). Potential for streamlined analysis, want to look at tools like Spark/Haddoop, OpenLab to help setting up a testbed</p>

<p>A lot of tools available to optimize data access and analysis, produced by industry but open-source</p>

<p>Event classification and triggering probably the most challenging use case: nothing really matching this in the industry but several frameworks can help</p>

<h3 id="recent-developments-in-roottmva---l-moneta">Recent Developments in ROOT/TMVA - L. Moneta</h3>

<p>TMVA future discussed last September. Core requirements identified.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maintain a set of core algorithms for HEP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Be able to interface with Python and R to allow the use of modern ML tools (done, PyMVA and RMVA)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Workflows integrated with ML frameworks</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Several actions decided, most of them already done or in progress: see slides</p>

<p>New method to compute Feature Importance based on contribution to the classifier</p>

<ul>
  <li>Independent of the actual classifier used</li>
</ul>

<p>New DL classes recently added supporting recent developments in the field: currently being optimized by TMVA developers</p>

<p>Cross validation also recently added</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support for // execution (Spark, multi-processes) being added</li>
</ul>

<p>Work in progress in TMVA</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Better separation of classification and regression and improved regression</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved perf and memory usage</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better support for parallelization</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Integration with ROOT-Books (Jupyter notebooks): Service for Web-based Analysis (SWAN). No SW installation required</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use general ROOT I/O instead of being limited to XML/JSON, import training output from other frameworks, import data from non ROOT formats (e.g. HDF5)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>5 students will work this summer funded by Google (Google Summer of Code program)</p>

<p>Welcoming more contributions to TMVA development</p>

<ul>
  <li>Join the developer team or issue pull request on gitHub</li>
</ul>

<p>V. Innocente: CMS has faced performance/mem footprint issues with TMVA DL classifiers in the context of reconstruction. We need to find solutions, e.g. reduced precision (FP16) which proves to be enough in many case.</p>

<p>Amir Farben: like TVMA interface but skeptical about trying to integrate anything into TMVA. Results is that it makes everything more complex, need to reinvent parallelisation optimisations…</p>

<p>Keras: Python library interfacing with tensor manipulation frameworks like TensorFlow (TF) and Theano</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Keras provides building blocks for users to construct deep learning models at a high level of abstraction</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theano and TF are high level wrappers around C++: efficiently call C++ from high level language</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Similar in many ways:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Computation described as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with tensors flowing along the edges</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Theano older, more stable API, faster for CNNs + interfaces with CuDNN (NVIDIA optimized kernels for NN operations)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>TF backed by Google + easier for distributed/cluster computing</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Theano: dynamic C code generation, stability optimization, execution speed optimisation, support for GPUs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>TensorFlow: meant for large scale deployment on heterogeneous systems/HW, support synchronous and asynchronous training, evolved from DistBelief</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In ATLAS:</p>

<h3 id="opendata-in-cms---k-lassila-perini">OpenData in CMS - K. Lassila-Perini</h3>

<p>Challenge: knowledge preservation</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We are good at keeping/saving “immediate” metadata related to data taking conditions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Not as good to save the context allowing to analyze properly the data: things trivial at the time of the experiment but easily lost</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>OpenData/preservation effort forces to address the “context metadata” preservation challenge. Beneficial for HEP community.</p>

<p>Lesson learned: much better to start the open data effort at the same time as data analysis is done but competing for human and computing resources…</p>

<ul>
  <li>Also making data public is not enough to make the data easy to understand/use… Requires a specific effort (LHCb has one FTE dedicated to maintain a guide describing all the trigger lines…)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="a-common-tracking-software---a-salzburger">A Common Tracking Software - A. Salzburger</h3>

<p>Code optimizations for Run1/2 can allow to meet the CPU challenge (ATLAS and CMS already achieved a 5x since beginning of Run1) in trigger/tracker: not the case for HL-LHC</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Need to start a R&amp;D but many barriers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Small community, but many challenges ahead (HL-LHC,FCC)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>ML currently used in tracking mainly for classification: just opening to pattern recognition with ML Tacking challenge</p>

<p>LHC detector SW has really been stress-tested: idea of starting an experiment-agnostic toolkit based on the experience gained (ACTS)</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>At the same time, often used on very old idea: such a toolkit may help to test new ideas</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Data model of tracking was designed to serve both tracking experts and end-users. Lead to many compromises. Turned out not to be needed / not being used as anticipated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Core tracking software put into standalone package ACTS now - on CERN’s gitlab. Decoupled from Gaudi/Athena, but with required adaptors to it for ease of integration.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Doesn’t want to replace/duplicate framework features: persistency, geometry… plugins for integration with frameworks. One the same line, do not duplicate G4.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACTS will be used by ATLAS at the core piece of its Run3 tracking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Proof of concept by FCC connecting ACTS with DD4HEP</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>ACTS example for the tracking machine learning challenge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Hope to demonstrate GaudiHive integration in ATLAS TIM workshop (June)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>License a question still to be tackled; question to the audience for help</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Tracking ML challenge: can be an important step but need to agree on what we expect from it. CMS and ATLAS have different expectations from the LVL1 trigger, need to build kind of an hybrid detector description.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Emphazing collaboration rather than competition</p>

<h3 id="sw-performance-alice---d-rohr">SW Performance <a href="https://github.com/ALICE" class="user-mention">@ALICE</a> - D. Rohr</h3>

<p>Current situation: fast online reconstruction + offline reconstruction</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Most compute-intensive task is tracking</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>GPU-based tracker: found the balanced config was 1 GPU per CPU</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Same code used for GPU and CPU: macros used for specific things, 90+% common code. Can use CUDA, OpenCL…</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Had to accept different floating rounding leading to a different result for a very small fraction of the clusters</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Managed to get tracker CPU time increasing linearly with the number of tracks: confident it will work for Run3</p>

<p>Run 3 challenge: currently &lt;2 Khz readout rate, moving to continuous readout at 50 Khz interaction rate</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Much more data: more efficient compression needed, based on reconstruction. Thus the need for full online reconstruction.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reconstruction requires precise calibration, thus online calibration</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New framework developed for Run 3: O2. Common development with FAIR (ALFA/FairROOT)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Better exploit of GPU concurrency: currently the number of tracks matches the internal GPU cores but will not be the case in the future: need to process several events concurrently in the same GPU. First tests promising: improved throughput. Current setup should be able to sustain 40 Khz.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Future directions</p>

<ul>
  <li>Remove multiple copy operations between CPU/GPU memory for the same event</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="atlas-observations---g-stewart">ATLAS Observations - G. Stewart</h3>

<p>ATLAS Performance Monitoring Board (PMB) in charge of monitoring information from job instrumentation and to report/understand in significant change in performance, memory footprint…</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Every change has to be justified: many related to bugs</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A justified change generally has to be compensated by another reduction</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>LS1 lesson: too many things to do (implement/test) in //</p>

<p>Linear algebra: CLHEP too slow, replaced by Eigen after a detailed evaluation</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>SIMD implementation available</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Painful migration but done implementing an abstract interface to help future migration if needed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Magnetic field access was a big CPU consumer: big impact on simulation, a lot of improvements in this area</p>

<ul>
  <li>All together: 5x improvement in reconstruction performance</li>
</ul>

<p>xAOD EDM: an important step to make analysis more efficient</p>

<ul>
  <li>Extensible format, ROOT readable</li>
</ul>

<p>Emphasis on code quality: critical to understand the code to improve it!</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Use several compilers, gcc plugin to detect some ATLAS coding standard violation</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Coverity</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Run3: framework evolution, no radical change</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>More concurrency, parallelism</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Gaudi work in conjunction with LHCb and FCC</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Offline code reviews can be a good occasion to make progress, identify problems… and ensure that developers document their design and implementation!</p>

<h3 id="cms---d-lange">CMS - D. Lange</h3>

<p>As others, reconstruction is the primary performance target: target, particle flow based object identification, high granularity calorimeter</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Already a lot of improvements done since the beginning of data taking to improve tracking and reconstruction time</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Need more to meet the HL-LHC challenge: computing resources are not going to match the increased time required by current implementation/approach</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of recent work in several different area: igprof has been an important tool to identify hotspots</p>

<ul>
  <li>Threading optimization: Intel VTune used successfully</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="astrophysics-experience---o-iffrig">Astrophysics Experience - O. Iffrig</h3>

<p>Challenge of a fluid dynamics simulation: large number of points O(1000) in the 3 directions, 10 double precision variables</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One step depends of the previous one: synchronisation required at each step</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>At least 2 steps at the same time in memory</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Parallelization was a requirement: based on MPI, each process has its own data, data exchanges at their border</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Bootlenecks: communications, border data duplication, load balancing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Currently works up to 10k processors: not enough</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On the current HPC machine used, a run lasts 10 days of WC time (not counting data transfer, maintenance, etc): limited number of simulations per campaign (Õ(4))</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Future directions explored:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Multiple threads per MPI tasks (openMP, pthreads…): benefit from shared memory</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use GPUs: vectorize as much as possible, optimize data exchange</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis is another challenge: many algorithms I/O bound</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Try to read data once</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Parallel algorithms</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Challenge of evolving a large code-base (O(100K) lines)… still work in progress</p>

<ul>
  <li>Between 10 and 100 developers</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="root-experience-and-challenges---p-mato">ROOT Experience and Challenges - P. Mato</h3>

<p>20 year old: reengineering/rewriting required in several areas, collaboration with the community required</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Aim to get much of the changes for performances transparent for the users</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Profiling is one particular area where collaboration is beneficial: see the igprof experience</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Parallelisation: multithreading and multi-processing</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>PROOF remains the most used approach for perf improvement</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>New MultiProc package</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Threading: new ThreadProc, same interface as multi-proc, output merging properly handled</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Multi-node, on-demand analysis: SWAN</p>

<p>I/O perf also deserves work: exploring several approaches, including new serialization formats</p>

<p>Plan to exploit JIT capability of LLVM/CLANG for perf optimization at run time</p>

<p>Exploring functional chains à la Spark: user specifies what, ROOT decides how, providing room for optimizations</p>

<p>Need to explore multiple approaches to meet the challenges: not a single solution for all the use cases</p>

<h3 id="artlarsoft---m-paterno">Art/LArSoft - M. Paterno</h3>

<p>Recent experience in MC G4 following an identified problem with memory footprint: problem turned out to be more complex than initially thought, a team of experts via different profiles assembled</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>People from experiments + G4 + experts in C++ profiling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Was used as a good occasion for mentoring</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Importance of validation tests: experiment tests are not enough. Changes should not impact physics output. Was critical to convince users to use the new code.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Lesson learned</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Clear out cached data as soon as they are no longer needed in member functions</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t cache data into algorithmic objects</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Avoid complex objects for small lookups: high memory cost</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concrete changes in a short time motivate people</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Would be better better to catch design problems earlier: main way to achieve it is collaboration during development, like for the development of an analysis</p>

<ul>
  <li>Peer reviews</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="geantv---j-apostolakis">GeantV - J. Apostolakis</h3>

<p>Simulation represents 50% of LHC computing: GV wants to improve perf by a 2.5 to 5x</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Redesign code with fine-grained granularity at the core</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Scalar &amp; vector interfaces (efficient use of SIMD instructions)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Concentrate first on geometry: 30-40% of the simulation CPU</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Every component/class has a test and a benchmark both for scalar and vector interfaces</p>

<ul>
  <li>Benchmark results compared with Geant4, ROOT, USolids</li>
</ul>

<p>Importance of I/O</p>

<p>Basketization is another critical part</p>

<ul>
  <li>Includes a lock-free scheduler</li>
</ul>

<p>Several developments could be backported to G4.</p>

<h3 id="discussion-panel">Discussion panel</h3>

<p>Graeme: hard limit to perf improvement set by HW. Changes in HW have a much higher latency than SW</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ultimate metrics is event throughput</li>
</ul>

<p>Olivier: relying on HPC, the HW question is different. Resources provided by national facilities. No control of it, GPUs will be part of next generation of machines.</p>

<p>D. Rohr (D.R.): GPUs are here, no discussion about using it. The question is the right balance between GPU and CPU: may change over time, also a chance to do it incrementally.</p>

<p>Liz: emphasize Oliver’s point of view. Same in the US: HEP encourage to join the HPC community and the HPC community has a roadmap that includes GPUs as a significant part of the next machine generation. Need to deal with HW heterogeneity increases the pressure on the build/packaging system.</p>

<p>Amir: need to work together as a community around the R&amp;D about these issues and come with a common framework that could be used as the basis for the computing infrastructure in 10 years. HSF could be the good place for this effort.</p>

<p>Pere: first step with GPU is to demonstrate the gain and for this, we need to identify the areas to concentrate on.</p>

<p>D.R.: easier to rewrite/adapt a specialized application (like tracking) than frameworks like ROOT and GEANT</p>

<p>Vincenzo: is there still a place for commodity HW? Pressed to join the HPC community: at the same time, less opportunity for commodity with automatic power-off capabilities in new HW… ARM vs. HPC: may achieve the same throughput without the big pressure on parallelization.</p>

<p>Graeme: no doubt we’ll have to rewrite a significant part of our code but it needs to match a large part of the architecture phase space. Need to rely on compiler and build systems to help with this.</p>

<p>J. Apostolakis (J.A.): impossible to say what will be the dominating infrastructure 5 years from now, need to remain flexible and be able to support multiple infrastructures at a low cost.</p>

<p>Olivier: current approach is to put the implementation details for each architecture in libraries and hide them from the users. No clear standard that could simplify the problem: still need to adapt to each architecture.</p>

<p>D.R.: ALICE took the opportunity of the requirement to rewrite the tracker to redesign it with GPU in mind. But originally not written for GPU.</p>

<p>Amir: expect to see different GPU HW for gaming/deep learning (16-bit precision for higher perf) and HPC (double precision). AMD being out of the HW business, it is in a better position to change the SW landscape around these new HW (well aware of the need to support many HW/programming environments).</p>

<p>Pere: need to prevent users specifying low-level things. If the user gives a high level description, it is easier for the system to do internal optimization.</p>

<p>Amir: need to look at what big players did to offload things like compression to GPUs. Highly connected with I/O and efficient I/Os from GPUs.</p>

<p>Pere: we need to assess the exact impact on the overall workflow of offloading one particular part to specialized HW. And compare it with the effort to support them.</p>

<p>Amir: HSF could have the role of identifying the needed R&amp;D and convince funding agencies to support it. We need topical workshops or topical sessions in regular meetings. Need to be proactive.</p>

<p>M. Sokoloff: if current NSF proposal moves forward, we’ll need to produce the Community White Paper in the next 15 months: The HSF is the natural organisation to do it.</p>

<p>Jeff: we need a metric for HSF work: maximize efficiency of overall people contributions.</p>

<p>Liz: ultimate goal remains to get additional people, not to play a zero-sum game.</p>

<p>Dario: importance of trainings to meet the challenge by increasing existing people expertise.</p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <p>May be useful to recognise merit of individuals, not so much internally in HEP but rather for people who will leave the field</p>

<h3 id="hsf-as-legal-entity">HSF as legal entity</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Proposal from Elizabeth Sexton-Kennedy and Fons Rademakers to seed HSF as a legal entity with an anchor project – much as Apache Software Foundation did with httpd – namely ROOT</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/contributions/1174794/attachments/1267586/1878295/HSF_workshop_Legal.pdf"><em>Slides from Liz</em></a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do this in parallel with – and without interference with – HSF’s ongoing activities</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would imply adding a Foundation Board, otherwise should not necessarily drive governance changes</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Main motivation is to have an entity that can take ownership of SW contributions in the community: clear ownership required to allow clear licensing and collaboration with other fields.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Has to be neutral</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Need a “core product” like Apache Server for ASF: ROOT?</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Need to find sponsors, including funding agencies</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Vincenzo: counter-example of Geant4, with a different form of organization, namely the G4 collaboration</p>

<p>Samir: if we want to increase collaboration with others, not clear that they all want to give up their IPR.</p>

<p>Andy: supportive of HSF being able of taking ownership of IPR but skeptical that existing big projects with huge IPR are good gunieapigs.</p>

<p>Markus: any Foundation would be established under a national law; would US institutes/agencies agree to give IP to a foundation under EU/CH law, or vice-versa?</p>

<h3 id="hsf-governance">HSF governance</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>So long as HSF remains an entirely unresourced volunteer activity, there is no motivation or justification to go to a heavier governance</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If/when the HSF becomes ‘resourced’ somehow, governance will need to be addressed</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hsf-center">HSF Center</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A suggestion from SLAC (Andy Hanushevsy): invite institutes to establish an ‘HSF Center’ as an anchor for their material (not person power) contributions to HSF</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>E.g. if institute X supports a Jenkins service for the use of HSF &amp; associated projects, the contribution comes as part of their HSF Center</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Would allow both the HSF and the institute to clearly identify contributions</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>For the institute, a means of clearly identifying participation and contribution to HEP S&amp;C common projects via HSF support</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>For the HSF, concretely identifies contributing institutes and their contributions, and can help incite more</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Maintain a list of services we would like Centers to pick up</p>

  <li>
    <p>Kickoff meeting in the US this Fall: “co-locate” with CHEP? Peter: should be driven/branded by HSF.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcomes-conclusions-next-steps">Outcomes, conclusions, next steps</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New activity around SW performance? Web site area?Should happen inside the SW technology forum but give more visibility to it in the “HSF space”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Project template, packaging</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The way the Mon morning discussion developed, towards managing a software stack and the issues taken up in the Packaging WG, suggests that we’re on the right track with the Packaging WG’s investigations into solutions</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Great interest in Spack but recognition in the packaging discussion that there’s no silver bullet</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Bigger interest by smaller projects/experiments not having the resources of LHC experiments</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Discussions here affirm the usefulness of the document describing and charting the features, pros, cons of the alternative</p>

            <p>Should be maintained actively</p>
          </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>No new things have popped up that ought to be added to HSF scope?</p>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>ML is the hot item of the day, and there we have the IML here today, and whatever relationship with the IML develops in the future. IML will use SW KB. Could also be part of HEP StackExchange.</p>
