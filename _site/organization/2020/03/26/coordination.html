<h2 id="news-general-matters">News, general matters</h2>

<h3 id="discussion-with-cms">Discussion with CMS</h3>

<p>We were invited by Danilo and Markus to give a talk to CMS in a <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/902343/">session on external projects</a> (along with IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Outline of the HSF, motivation and history</li>
  <li>Current structure and activities</li>
  <li>Prospects for future collaboration and impact</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="proto-sidis">Proto-SIDIS</h3>

<p>The “<a href="https://sidis.web.cern.ch/">Software Institute for Data Intensive Sciences (SIDIS)</a>” is an initiative to establish connections and promote common R&amp;D between software engineers in natural sciences and computer science departments at universities, currently focusing on European partners. SIDIS currently is in a conceptualisation phase.</p>

<p>The activities of SIDIS are regularly discussed on the <strong>third Wednesday of the month, 10.00 - 11.00 CE(S)T</strong>, in the <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/category/11734/">SIDIS Coordination meeting</a>. The meeting usually contains topics to discuss and is public. If you are interested in a specific topic or SIDIS in general please join.</p>

<p>Current activities of SIDIS are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the “Alpaka training and hackathon (see below)” in collaboration with HSF, Openlab and <a href="https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=1227&amp;pLang=en">CASUS</a></li>
  <li>a “Topical Workshop on accelerator programming” tentatively to be held in early December with the goals to
    <ul>
      <li>Draw a landscape of current national initiatives similar to SIDIS and connecting those</li>
      <li>Exercise the core idea of SIDIS to connect computer scientists and natural scientists, aiming at interactivity as much as possible</li>
      <li>Establish common R&amp;D activities amongst computer science and natural science</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If you are interested in SIDIS please <a href="https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSubscription.do?egroupName=proto-sidis-concept">subscribe to proto-sidis-concept@cern.ch</a>. In case you don’t have a CERN account you need to follow some <a href="https://sidis.web.cern.ch/node/44">special instructions to subscribe</a>. Meetings will be also announced on this list.</p>

<h3 id="alpaka-training-event">Alpaka training event</h3>

<p>This has had to be postponed for now. If you are interested please sign up at <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/883212/">https://indico.cern.ch/event/883212/</a>. We will inform participants when the new date (tentatively end of June) and format have been decided.</p>

<h2 id="google-summer-of-code-2020">Google Summer of Code 2020</h2>

<p>The GSoC timeline has been updated: <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline">https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline</a></p>

<p>The student application deadline is still March 31, but the student proposal review period is now March 31-April 20. So the new <em>deadline for finishing the student evaluations is April 16</em> (instead of April 10), giving us few days to evaluate the number of slots we need to ask.</p>

<h2 id="lhcc-review-of-hl-lhc-software-and-computing">LHCC Review of HL-LHC Software and Computing</h2>

<p><em>Reminder</em>: LHCC will review software and computing plans for the HL-LHC, Amber Boehnlein (JLab) will chair. Five 20 page documents provided as input to the committee, from ATLAS, CMS, WLCG, DOMA and from <em>Common Tools and Community Software</em> (the HSF takes care of the later)</p>

<p><em>Latest News</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li>There will be no face to face meeting, there will be a one day virtual meeting instead</li>
  <li>Present each of the 5 documents (20’) + discussion (20’)</li>
  <li>Participation: review panel, LHCC chair (Frank Simon), 1-2 people per document (about 25)</li>
  <li>1 May deadline for the documents is maintained</li>
  <li>Foresee one more virtual meeting in the Autumn, a f2f meeting next year in Q2 2021
    <ul>
      <li>No news yet on how this affects a common software in-depth review in Autumn 2021</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ai7m7kFyiGgl2tKralJKyPX6rlD9tffU7B6wPj_vpZU/edit?usp=sharing">Document outline</a> has been created and now has a fair amount of material.</p>

<p><em>Aim is now to have a reasonable draft by the end of this month, with all sections populated.</em> This allows for our own review and an alignment with the other documents.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Some introductory text has been written covering a few topics at high level:
    <ul>
      <li>Technology Evolution
        <ul>
          <li>Compute devices and APIs</li>
          <li>Storage systems</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Software Tools and Packaging</li>
      <li>Training</li>
      <li>Software Distribution (CVMFS)</li>
      <li>Software Preservation</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Please take a look and decide if we need to expand on any points (but remember the target audience)</em></p>

<h3 id="event-generators">Event Generators</h3>

<p>The draft contribution of the WG has been merged into the full HSF document, although it still needs to receive feedback from all of the WG. Presently 5 pages plus one of references (do others foresee references, too?). This is a shorter version of the draft that was prepared last month, which we plan to complete on the same timescale and upload to arXiv (or submit to a journal).</p>

<h3 id="detector-simulation">Detector Simulation</h3>
<p>Draft of the simulation chapter for LHCC review completed and merged into the full HSF document.</p>

<h3 id="reconstruction-and-software-triggers">Reconstruction and Software Triggers</h3>

<p>Were drafting text in a different document - can now move this into the main document. Contacted more trigger &amp; reco common efforts, most of them have replied / have promised to reply.</p>

<h3 id="data-analysis">Data Analysis</h3>

<p>Draft added before last meeting, not substantially changed, but a few spots will require further input, notably:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Discussion of new analysis tools (including PyHep, ROOT developments) to be expanded</li>
  <li>Prospects/R&amp;D section will be updated with information gathered from meetings this Spring including DAWG-DOMA discussions (see below)</li>
  <li>Fact-checking, references, numbers…</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hsf-feedback-process">HSF Feedback Process</h3>

<p><strong>Discussion <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/902139/">with CMS</a></strong> happened on Tuesday 24, points that came up were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Is there an overall plan and priority?
    <ul>
      <li>No and we did not expect to have one at this stage</li>
      <li>Prioritisation can happen on a profiled basis (invest more in the more expensive areas); <em>however every experiment is at a different working point, so no one-size-fits-all recommendation</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HSF should comment on the performance of generators, not on the decisions of the experiments
    <ul>
      <li>Indeed, but comparison of ATLAS and CMS led to significant insights in this area; it is not a competitive or pejorative comparison - this was the spirit of the study, which was led by ATLAS and CMS generator experts</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>WLCG does not foresee ‘analysis facilities’ being distinguished at the resource accounting level (they stick to the Tier 0/1/2 model)
    <ul>
      <li>ALICE plans are more for a reduction facility</li>
      <li>(Graeme personal comment) true analysis facilities are very much at the R&amp;D stage</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Further Feedback</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Make public release of document at the <em>beginning of next week</em> (probably needs some tidying)
    <ul>
      <li>Commentable in Google Docs</li>
      <li>WGs can update and resolve comments as they come in; flag up controversial points</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Organise one longer feedback meeting, but also decide in advance what topics need discussion time</li>
  <li><strong>Proposal:</strong> HSF review and feedback Thursday 16 April, 15-17h
    <ul>
      <li>In the coordination slot, but out of phase (we know this time is reasonably free from clashes)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="working-group-updates">Working Group Updates</h2>

<h3 id="data-analysis-1">Data Analysis</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Very interesting discussions in the joint meeting with WLCG-DOMA: <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/890991/">https://indico.cern.ch/event/890991/</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Would be useful to define benchmarks and inject realism into tests -&gt; will followup (homework for the convenors)</li>
      <li>Emphasis (rightly) on the streamlined reduction model (nanoAOD, PHYS_LITE), but we need to consider the “10%” that can’t fit into that model</li>
      <li>How will exclusive analysis (e.g. LHCb, Belle II) work, similar?  Or would ServiceX be an even better fit there?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analysis language workshop is postponed, hope is still to have a face to face meeting but in “wait and see” mode</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="detector-simulation-1">Detector Simulation</h3>
<p>Topical <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/899153/">meeting 25th of March 2020</a> focused on non-LHC experiments. One talk from neutrino experiments (NOvA, SBN and DUNE) and one from Belle II. Neutrino community would appreciate a lot having a GPU-based module for optical photons transport that could be integrated into Geant4, as this currently is a very CPU-consuming part of the simulation.</p>

<p>Next topical meeting to be decided, but target is end April, beginning May.</p>

<h3 id="reconstruction-and-software-triggers-1">Reconstruction and Software Triggers</h3>

<p>Next meeting confirmed for April 1st 17-18h, ATLAS/CMS CPU optimization experiences in reconstruction code. In calendar, will be announced today.</p>

<p>General HSF question: we had a researcher contacting us to do some hands-on work in the WG. We think this is great! We could go two ways:</p>
<ul>
  <li>give him the set of projects and putting him in touch with the one that matches his interest</li>
  <li>ask him to help out with making one of the projects more cross-collaboration</li>
  <li>other opinions…</li>
</ul>

<p>Opinions on what’s best for HSF?</p>
<ul>
  <li>In general this is very positive; we are very keen on work that <em>generalises software to a larger community</em>, but do need to check that the projects themselves are amenable is important</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="software-tools-and-packaging">Software Tools and Packaging</h3>

<ul>
  <li>In case people have missed it, you can access the agenda for the OpenLAB/Intel remote session on oneAPI <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/878418/timetable/?view=standard">here</a>:
    <ul>
      <li>Material is available for future reference.</li>
      <li>In particular, <em>Offload Advisor</em> (What should I offload to a GPU?) looks like an interesting tool that we can discuss in one of the upcoming meetings. If you have any experience w/ it (especially in a real-life example) please get in touch w/ us.</li>
      <li>Majority of the session was dedicated to DPC++.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>From Ben: “[…] collect a list of packages we need in Spack, but not currently there. I’ve got a feeling there are several efforts out there writing their own recipes, but in either case it could be good to get this in place.”
    <ul>
      <li>To be followed up possibly via e-mail and/or a meeting.</li>
      <li>LCG release contents would be a good starting point</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="event-generators-1">Event generators</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Development on GPU port of MG5aMC is progressing. Planning a meeting on Monday including CERN, Louvain and Argonne contributors.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="frameworks">Frameworks</h3>

<p>We have scheduled a meeting for next week (April 1) to discuss the JANA framework’s multi-threaded scheduling mechanisms.  This inaugurates a series of meetings devoted toward exploring how different experiments handle the scheduling of steps to be performed in a multi-threaded environments.</p>

<h3 id="hsfwlcg-2020-workshop">HSF/WLCG 2020 workshop</h3>

<p>For a re-scheduled full workshop <strong>21-25 September is the proposal being discussed</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>We have pre-booked the same venue in Lund (social dinner moved to Tuesday as there are more takers for Fall conferences)</li>
  <li>No one knows how the situation will evolve, so more news will come before the summer</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="virtual-event-proposal">Virtual Event Proposal</h4>

<p>The Scientific Organising Team continued discussing what we could do as a virtual event in the May slot</p>

<p>Current proposal to organise a <em>3</em> session event, focused on <strong>New Architectures, Portability, and Sustainability</strong> (i.e. the Tuesday Lund plenary session), but to have these three sessions spread over 3 days and <em>only for 2 hours</em> (roughly the time we feel that people can concentrate on remote hosted events)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monday 11, Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13; 16-18h CERN time (fairly friendly from Europe to the N American Pacific coast)
    <ul>
      <li>Day 1 - Code portability, Common software</li>
      <li>Day 2 - Workflows (Framework, WMS)</li>
      <li>Day 3 - Validation, Pledges, Benchmarking</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>We would like speakers to upload their material <em>well</em> in advance.</li>
  <li>Have a notes document where people can post questions, also in advance.</li>
  <li>Almost certainly we would use Zoom which has some nice features for larger meetings.</li>
  <li>Setup a semi-permanent chat channel (not just VC chat), like Slack or Mattermost.</li>
  <li>[discussion needed] material can be indexed on Zenodo, including recordings
    <ul>
      <li>Practically, use Indico to get recording permission</li>
      <li>Not planning to pre-record talks, but to have material still presented during the event</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>This would be a learning experience for the community, that could lead the way towards less travel and f2f meetings as well as keeping activities running in times of COVID-19.</em></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Is this worthwhile doing?</strong> Please <em>do</em> give feedback on whether you believe this event is good to organise and if you would attend it (in particular, if your feelings are <em>negative</em>)
    <ul>
      <li>Liz - virtual meetings need to have a specific focus, but experience of virtual CMS S&amp;C week is positive</li>
      <li>David - <em>Connecting the Dots</em> will be pre-recording material (otherwise not practical to do 20hrs of material from many timezones), so this will provide some experience of an alternative format</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="pyhep-2020-workshop"><a href="http://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2020">PyHEP 2020 Workshop</a></h3>
<ul>
  <li>We will decide on the format of PyHEP 2020 next week.</li>
  <li>In touch with SciPy 2020 conference chairs for what happens there.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="aob">AOB</h2>

<p>We changed to Zoom this week, a regular meeting has been booked until the end of the year</p>
<ul>
  <li>Please give <a href="https://espace.cern.ch/AVC-workspace/videoconference/Lists/Zoom%20Pilot%20Feedback/overview.aspx">feedback on your Zoom experience</a> to CERN IT</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="next-meeting">Next Meeting</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Next regular meeting slot is 9 April</li>
