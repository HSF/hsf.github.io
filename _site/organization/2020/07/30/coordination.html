<p>The best practices proposal note has been released as HSF-TN-2020-01 (<a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3965581#.XyK7DS-w0gt">https://zenodo.org/record/3965581#.XyK7DS-w0gt</a>).</p>

<h3 id="iris-hep-blueprint-meeting-on-sustainable-software-in-hep">IRIS-HEP Blueprint Meeting on <em>Sustainable Software in HEP</em></h3>

<p><a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/930127/">https://indico.cern.ch/event/930127/</a></p>

<p>Well attended (up to 70) with a series of talks from HEP (ATLAS, CMS, HSFx2 (General + Training)) and other communities, like Software Sustainability Institute, AstroPy, The Carpentries.</p>

<p>In the breakout sessions there was a lot of interest in policy decisions in training and careers (important, but hard to turn into actionable items).</p>

<p>Summary and outcomes in preparation.</p>

<h3 id="escape-workshop-on-open-source-software-lifecycles-july-23-24--27-28">ESCAPE Workshop on Open Source Software Lifecycles (July 23, 24 + 27, 28)</h3>

<p><a href="https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/21698/">https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/21698/</a></p>

<p>Week-long (half-day/full-day) workshop organized by ESCAPE Project.</p>

<p><em>Focus of the workshop:</em> expert/community (mostly astrophysics) talks, aiming to understand best practices on open source software in terms of development/licensing/…</p>

<p>HSF contributions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>HSF Talk given by Lukas Heinrich (with Graeme’s input)</li>
  <li>Benchmarking talk given by Andrea Valassi</li>
  <li>Also DM Test Science Project 5’ talk</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Ultimate goal:</em> apply best practices to ESCAPE Software Catalogue
Best practices notes: <a href="https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/jutta.schnabel/wossl/-/wikis/Best-Practices-for-software-development">https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/jutta.schnabel/wossl/-/wikis/Best-Practices-for-software-development</a></p>

<p>Some interesting topics: <a href="https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta">CodeMeta</a> as a way to add metadata to software - hold this close to the code/developers, but then use it to power the catalogue; software archive project: <a href="https://archive.softwareheritage.org/">https://archive.softwareheritage.org/</a>.</p>

<p>Outstanding question: which facilities / “middleware” will be used to run pipelines? Could use the occasion for a joint session at the November workshop?</p>

<p>Licensing discussion: broadly in line with HSF conclusions (favour liberal licenses; labs holding copyright for telescopes). Overview of legal aspects was useful (Carina Haupt).</p>

<p>Q&amp;A: try to increase involvement of theory and generator community.</p>

<h3 id="lhcc-review-of-hl-lhc-software-and-computing">LHCC Review of HL-LHC Software and Computing</h3>

<p>Report is attached to the agenda.</p>

<h4 id="highlight-points">Highlight points</h4>

<ul>
  <li>HSF is generally praised for providing a discussion and coordination forum
    <ul>
      <li>Which is recognised by the experiments and the community</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Common software noted to be important and likely to be more important in the future
    <ul>
      <li>R&amp;D for non-CPU devices noted</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Funding situation for computational improvements to generators does not fit into current scheme</li>
  <li>Improvements in generators and detector simulation are part of the CMS and ATLAS strategy and effort is needed here</li>
  <li>Lack of career opportunity is a risk</li>
  <li>Training and education are important</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="common-activity-and-projects-examples">Common activity and projects examples</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Reconstruction algorithms</li>
  <li>Analysis preservation</li>
  <li>Common approaches and best practice for accelerators
    <ul>
      <li><em>Have been discussing this in the SIDIS context and that could fit well as a joint activity</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>(Conditions) databases?
    <ul>
      <li><em>That is verbatim what is in the report</em></li>
      <li><em>DUNE actively working on that kind of infrastructure</em></li>
      <li><em>CREST project was started in HSF, but was unclear how much the experiments bought-in</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="comments">Comments</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Formalise the role by which WLCG priorities can be transmitted to the HSF
    <ul>
      <li><em>Have discussed with Simone doing this via the WLCG MB</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Continue efforts on common software (ROOT, Geant4), in consulation with WLCG and LHC experiments</li>
  <li>Consider structures that would allow FAs to make formal commitments to software
    <ul>
      <li><em>We agitate here generally, but actions?</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Participate in intentaional standards bodies
    <ul>
      <li><em>Community has representation on C++ committee; anything else?</em></li>
      <li><em>Python is our other major language (they use PEPs); Python Software Foundation membership?</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>HSF could be involved in analysis preservation activities</li>
</ul>

<p>Second review anticipated in 9-12 months on detailed R&amp;D roadmaps.</p>

<p><strong>Encourage people to read the report and think about practical outcomes for the HSF.</strong></p>

<h4 id="authorship-progress">Authorship Progress</h4>

<p>We agreed (16 July meeting #160) to broaden the author list of the HSF input document.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Generators:
    <ul>
      <li>Agreed to use longer paper author list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Simulation:
    <ul>
      <li>To be discussed</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Reconstruction:
    <ul>
      <li>we sent emails around, already several people replied and asked to be added,</li>
      <li>request from the LHCb for slightly changing the text about Allen. Proposed change:
        <blockquote>
          <p>“Allen is a data processing framework for GPUs, as well as a specific implementation of a first-level trigger for LHCb. It will go into production for Run-3 data-taking at LHCb paired with a second trigger stage running on CPUs using highly vectorized code. Allen is optimised for sustaining the rate…”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>Approved for the updated Snowmass version</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Different contacts interpret “authorlist” differently (from ‘everyone who worked in the project cited’ to ‘only those who gave input to the HSF document’)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Analysis:
    <ul>
      <li>Follow-up offline</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Generally we favour an inclusive approach, so anyone reasonably connected to projects and development in the field can be an author.</p>

<p>Agreed to send a general email to hsf-forum, calling for people to contact the editors to add their names.</p>

<h3 id="new-convenor-for-data-analysis-wg">New Convenor for Data Analysis WG</h3>

<p>Reminder that nominations (including self-nominations) are open until 31 July for someone to join Paul and TJ (the appointment is to run from 1 September through 2021).</p>

<p>Please send nomintions to <a href="mailto:hsf-search-committee@cern.ch">hsf-search-committee@cern.ch</a> (which maps to Graeme, Liz and Michel).</p>

<p><em>We have quite a lot of nominations now - many thanks to those who made them.</em></p>

<h3 id="snowmass">Snowmass</h3>

<p>Reminder that announcements about the Snowmass process was sent to the email list, with an <a href="https://indico.fnal.gov/event/43829/">initial workshop on 10-11 August</a>.</p>

<p>We will submit the LHCC input document to the review (which we agreed did not need to go via an LoI).</p>

<h3 id="c-course">C++ Course</h3>

<p>Following up e.g. on discussions in the IRIS-HEP SW Sustainability workshop we want to propose a C++ course. Sebastien Ponce has created <a href="http://sponce.web.cern.ch/sponce/C++Course/">a lot of material</a> and given the course in several occasions already (LHCb, ESIPAP). Some concrete ideas</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sebastien is willing to teach this courses</li>
  <li>Format (all virtual)
    <ul>
      <li>2 hours of lecture sessions with moderated questions and answers in the morning</li>
      <li>Afternoons free for exercises, students can join breakout rooms in case of problems</li>
      <li>The morning after quick recap of the exercises before continuing with next training session</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Proposed weeks for first iteration are either
    <ul>
      <li>12 - 16 October (clashes: CSC (?), CMS S&amp;C, ATLAS collab)</li>
      <li>19 - 23 October (clashes: ALICE mini week, ML workshop, Snowmass planning, FR + CH school holidays)</li>
      <li>In this first iteration we plan to do the training in the morning CEST; in case of more iterations go for CEST afternoon trainings for the next one.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Aiming for ~2 training weeks / year</li>
  <li>Limit for the first iteration to max 50 people to allow interaction (especially with virtual training). If successful go higher for next iteration
    <ul>
      <li>Introduce “waiting list” if needed to also gauge the level of interest</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tentative morning schedule:</li>
</ul>

    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p><strong>Afternoons (Mo - Thu):</strong> Exercises with help by mentors in breakout rooms</p>

<p><strong><em>IMPORTANT</em></strong> We would need more mentors for the afternoon exercises !!!</p>

<p>Sam was contacted by someone from Orsay (?) also wanting to help with this kind of event. Can we recast the material into the HSF/Software Carpentry format? Example: <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/</a>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There is now a repo, <a href="https://gitlab.cern.ch/sponce/cpluspluscourse">https://gitlab.cern.ch/sponce/cpluspluscourse</a>, and can do a PR there (this is beamer format)</li>
  <li>Would want help to do this from other people</li>
</ul>

<p>Limiting to 50 could be a “problem” - we think we would go way beyond that in interest we expect (200-300?).</p>

<ul>
  <li>Organiser’s idea was to restrict the numbers to allow interactivity during the lecture (otherwise we can scale up a lot)</li>
  <li>Sam noted it’s hard to get honest input about what people’s level actually is</li>
  <li>Experience is that only 50% of people actually turn up for tutorials, even with a emailed pledge</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other formats that have been tried, with pre-recorded material (flipped classroom).</p>

<p>FNAL C++ course is also going ahead (already quite popular). All online this year. There is material available as well.</p>

<p><strong>In general this is received very positively. Continue to iterate on organisational details.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>Together with the call for names of the HSF document, we asked for updates to text of the various open source / cross-collaboration efforts that we can put on your website (our summer project)</li>
