<h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="/events/2018/10/12/generators.html">HSF/LPCC Physics Event Generator Computing Workshop, 26-27 November 2018</a></h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">12 Oct 2018 by <a href="/events/2018/10/12/generators.html">Graeme Stewart</a></p>

<p>The HSF and the LPCC are happy to announce a
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/751693/">joint workshop</a> on computing and
software challenges for event generators.</p>

<p>This event will focus on the challenges for physics event generators that need
to be faced in HEP in the next decade, many of which were identified in the
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982">HSF Community White Paper</a>.</p>

<p>Many physics searches will require enhanced precision, calling for generators
which are both more compute intensive and have a larger spread of weights.
This, coupled with an increasingly heterogeneous and concurrent processing
landscape, poses serious technical challenge for much of the generator code
and calls for a rethinking of how to best use precision event
generator predictions.</p>

<p>The workshop will review the current and projected computational needs of the
experiments for generating the MC samples they need to achieve their physics
goals, and the plans and concerns of several generator teams, with the aim of
identifying the most crucial areas where technical and organisational
improvements are needed.</p>

<p>We aim to identify a programme of work that can be used to attract investment
and focus effort in these technical areas, aiming to have software engineers
who can work together with the generator authors, improving the current codes
and making new theoretical advances easier to implement in a computationally
efficient way. We will try to find areas where experiments can work together
to use event generator codes more efficiently.</p>

<p>The workshop is open to all interested parties, from the experiments and the
theory community, but in particular to those who write and maintain the
generator codes, from the major experiments and to experts in software
engineering in HEP.</p>

<p><a href="mailto:hsf-generator-engineering-ws-organisation@googlegroups.com">Contact the organisers</a>
for any aspect of the workshop or if you would like to make a suggestion for
specific topics to cover.</p>

<p>Workshop Chairs: Stefan Hoche, Graeme Stewart, Andrea Valassi</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="/events/2017/05/30/cwp-annecy-ws.html">HEP Software Foundation Workshop, LAPP (Annecy, France), June 26-30, 2017</a></h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">30 May 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/05/30/cwp-annecy-ws.html">Michel Jouvin</a></p>

<p>Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments over the next 10 years will require the HEP community 
to address a number of challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve and 
that a significant “software upgrade” is required.</p>

<p>The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has been working since January on a Community White Paper (CWP) that 
will define a roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&amp;D for the 2020s. After the <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/">initial 
workshop</a> at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), 
many topical working groups have been formed to discuss the various aspects of the CWP.</p>

<p>This <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/613093/overview">HSF workshop</a> at LAPP (Annecy, France) will conclude the work of these WGs and prepare the final 
CWP. The agenda will be a mix of plenary sessions to share the work done so far by the 
WGs and parallel sessions to finalize the work in each WG. The work of each WG is public: 
see <a href="http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html">HSF web site</a> for details.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="/events/2017/05/22/analysis.html">HSF workshop on the HEP analysis ecosystem, Amsterdam, May 22-24 2017</a></h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">22 May 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/05/22/analysis.html">Torre Wenaus</a></p>

<p>Over the past 20 years the HEP community has developed and gravitated around an analysis ecosystem centered on ROOT. ROOT and its ecosystem both dominate HEP analysis and impact the full event processing chain, providing foundation libraries, I/O services etc. that have prevalence in the field.</p>

<p>The analysis tools landscape is however evolving in ways that can have a durable impact on the analysis ecosystem and a strong influence on the analysis and core software landscape a decade from now, a timescale currently in an intensive planning round with the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) Community White Paper process. Data intensive analysis is growing in importance in other sciences and in the wider world. Powerful tools and new development initiatives, both within our field and in the wider open source community, have emerged. Creative developers have an ever more powerful open source toolkit available and are applying it towards innovations that leverage both open source and the ROOT ecosystem. ROOT itself is approaching a major re-engineering with ROOT 7, leveraging the powerful evolution of C++, with a major overhaul in its interfaces as seen both by its users and by satellite tools in the ROOT ecosystem.</p>

<p>With these considerations we are organizing this open HEP software community workshop convened by the HSF to examine the analysis ecosystem, currently and in the future with a 5-10 year view. The workshop will be something of a retreat aimed at an inclusive building of consensus among developers, users, projects and their supporters in the HEP analysis ecosystem.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="/events/2017/03/28/VisualizationWorkshop.html">First HSF Visualization Workshop, CERN, Mar 28-30 2017</a></h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">28 Mar 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/03/28/VisualizationWorkshop.html">Riccardo Maria Bianchi</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/617054/">First HSF Visualization Workshop</a>
takes place from the <strong>28th to the 30th of March 2017</strong>, at CERN and remotely.
It spans three afternoons, to let US colleagues connect remotely through the Vidyo video-conference system.</p>

<p><strong>Visualization plays an important role in HEP</strong>. It is not only used to produce event displays for physics analysis, papers, press releases and Outreach&amp;Education material. But it is also used at many different levels in HEP experiments, to visualize experiments’ data  for a number of tasks: to support detector development, to verify the simulation and to check the reconstruction algorithms, to name a few.</p>

<p><strong>A long time had passed</strong> since the last time the HEP Visualization community gathered to share their software tools, ideas and thoughts. Also, nowadays computer graphics and the related technologies offer many <strong>open-source tools</strong>, which are worth to be considered by the HEP Visualization community, to be tested for our purposes.</p>

<p>This workshop aims at gathering Visualization experts and all interested people from the HEP community, to present their work and thoughts. Also, the goal is to <strong>find new ways of collaborative efforts</strong>, to build a shared view towards <strong>HEP common software tools</strong>.</p>

<p>Beside that, <strong>invited speakers from industry</strong> – NVIDIA, KDAB, The Qt Company – will share with us their views and the open-source technologies they support.</p>

<p>The <strong>agenda of the Visualization Workshop</strong> can be found here:</p>

<p>https://indico.cern.ch/event/617054/</p>

<p>A <strong>follow-up meeting</strong> will take place on <strong>Friday the 7th of April 2017</strong>, at CERN and remotely on Vidyo.
The follow-up meeting is meant to let the colleagues who could not attend the main workshop to present their work.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title"><a href="/events/2017/03/09/ReactiveX.html">Software Technology R&amp;D Forum - ReactiveX</a></h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">09 Mar 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/03/09/ReactiveX.html">Axel Naumann</a></p>

<p>We are happy to announce the next installment of the Software Technology
R&amp;D Forum, with a real technology highlight and speaker gem.</p>

<p>We managed to secure Kirk Shoop (Microsoft), the author of rxcpp, an
implementation of the <a href="http://reactivex.io">ReactiveX</a> “approach”. This
is a data-driven way of concurrent processing, leveraged for instance by
Netflix. Some see it as the language-independent destination of all
concurrency efforts, after we gave up on dealing with low-level entities
like tasks and futures.</p>

<p>After his <a href="http://cseminar.web.cern.ch/cseminar/2017/0309">Computing Seminar</a> (which will be recorded
but not webcast) he offered a workshop-style session to discuss how to
cast existing algorithms into the ReactiveX approach, with rxcpp as an
example. Apart from his presentation, we would like to expose him to
challenges from our environment and see how well ReactiveX maps to this.</p>

<p>You are cordially invited to bring those challenges with you, for
instance by a two-slides presentation. Please contact the organizers if
you volunteer to expose your concurrency / data processing challenges!</p>

<p>The session is scheduled for <em>Thursday March 9, 17:00</em> GVA time (NOTE
the unusual day and time due to speaker availability). At CERN, the
physical location will be 32-1-A24; see
<a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/614559/">https://indico.cern.ch/event/614559/</a> for slides and Vidyo.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>Axel with Peter and Jerome.</p>

<p class="blog-post-meta">06 Mar 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/03/06/CTDWIT.html">David Rousseau</a></p>

<p>The <a href="https://ctdwit2017.lal.in2p3.fr">2017 Connecting The Dots / Intelligent Tracker Workshop </a>
takes place from 6th to 9th of March at LAL-Orsay (close to Paris).
With the parallel progress in pattern recognition algorithms and microelectronic technology, the design and performance of tracking detector is rooted in the solid interplay of hardware and software : sensors, readout and trigger electronics, online and offline reconstruction software. The main focus of the workshop is on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms devoted to the reconstruction of particle tracks or jets in high energy physics experiments, and the hardware developments that enable them.</p>

<p>This 2017 edition is a merger of the Connecting The Dot series with the Workshop on Intelligent Tracker series.</p>

<p class="blog-post-meta">23 Jan 2017 by <a href="/events/2017/01/23/Workshop.html">Pere Mato</a></p>

<p>This workshop will take place at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC) and the University of California at San Diego (UCSD).</p>

<p>This HEP Software Foundation (HSF) workshop will focus in particular on the Community White Paper (CWP), A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&amp;D for the 2020s.</p>

<p>Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve and a significant “software upgrade” is required to prepare. In order to identify and prioritize the software research and development investments required, we are now beginning a community planning process. The aim is to produce a Community White Paper (CWP) which will describe the community strategy and a roadmap for software and computing R&amp;D in HEP for the 2020s. This activity is organised under the umbrella of the HSF. The LHC experiments and HSF have been specifically charged by the WLCG project and we are reaching out to other HEP experiments around the world to participate.</p>

<p>This HSF workshop at SDSC/UCSD will be the first workshop supporting the CWP process. There will be plenary sessions covering topics of general interest as well as parallel sessions for the many topical working groups in progress for the CWP.</p>

<p>The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has organized an open meeting at the request of the <a href="http://geant.cern.ch/">GeantV</a> project. 
A group of community experts has been empanelled and provided with a charge to guide an assessment of the project. The panel is asked to produce a report that summarizes the meeting and make observations and recommendations constituting advice to the GeantV team to help it improve its work and set the future direction.

<p class="blog-post-meta">04 Mar 2016 by <a href="/events/2016/03/04/Workshop.html">Michel Jouvin</a></p>

<p>The HEP Software Foundation had its first formative workshop at SLAC in January 2015. That workshop led to the establishment of HSF activity areas in the topics of greatest community interest identified at the workshop, with an organization following the model of a community-driven “do-ocracy”. Since then, these activities have developed and new opportunities present themselves.</p>

<p>The HSF will hold its second workshop <strong>May 2-4 2016 at LAL in Orsay</strong>, near Paris (France). <a href="http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/?lang=en">LAL</a> have kindly volunteered to host, assuring us of another fine venue. Registration is open with all the logistics/travel information: <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/e/HSFWorkshop2016">https://indico.cern.ch/e/HSFWorkshop2016</a>. The program will have two main elements. The first element will be a plenary gathering with talks and discussion on progress
 to date and future plans, how to garner greater participation, new initiatives and projects, and guest speakers from the open software community. The second element will be a select number of focused mini-workshops and hackathons, in areas of current or potential HSF activity that are of broad interest and relevance, with hands-on objectives. The ‘do-ocracy’ part of the program.</p>

<p>Workshop content and topics have not been finalized, we would like your input in order to do that, but a <a href="https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/timetable">working-draft</a> program is here, together with a <a href="http://doodle.com/poll/8hpxredhnci2i8xh">doodle poll</a> to quickly collect your input. Registration is open and logistics have been established. <strong>Please register!</strong></p>

<p class="blog-post-meta">21 Jan 2015 by <a href="/events/2015/01/21/SLAC.html">Torre Wenaus</a></p>

<p>The HSF had a workshop at SLAC’s Kavli Auditorium in January 2015, Tue 20 - Wed 
21, with discussions continuing on Thu 22. The main goal of the workshop was to 
refine the next steps for building the HSF. The workshop was successful in 
this, with about 100 participants (80 local and 20 remote) contributing to 
establishing a concrete set of community mandated activities for the HSF. 
Several workshop summaries presented around the community are attached to this 
page. The list of registrants is available on the workshop website linked
