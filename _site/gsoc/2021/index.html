  <h1 id="-google-summer-of-code-2021"><img src="/images/CERN-HSF-GSoC-logo.png" alt="CERN" height="100px" /> Google Summer of Code 2021</h1>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com">Google Summer of Code</a> is a program that allows students to contribute to the development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations.</p>

<p>Particle physics is an exciting field where large collaborations of scientists collect
and analyze petabytes of data from high-energy physics experiments, such as those at the Large Hadron Collider,
hosted at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
Some of the questions that we collectively ask are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>what are the fundamental blocks that make up our Universe?</li>
  <li>what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy?</li>
  <li>what is the nature of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter?</li>
  <li>what was early Universe like?</li>
</ul>

<p>To answer these questions, particle physicists build software to simulate and analyze what happens in particle physics detectors.</p>

<p>The CERN software for experiments (CERN EP-SFT) group has participated in the GSoC since 2011. Since 2017 the program has expanded to involve the high-energy physics community under the umbrella of the HEP Software Foundation.</p>

<p>Information from last year’s GSoC can be found <a href="/gsoc/2020/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="gsoc-2021">GSoC 2021</h3>

<p>In 2021 HSF is participating in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization, under the name CERN-HSF. The HSF project ideas are listed <a href="#projects-in-2021">below</a>. There are important changes in the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules/">program rules</a>  and the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/">timeline</a> compared to the previous year, described in the GSoC 2021 <a href="https://groups.google.com/g/google-summer-of-code-discuss/c/GgvbLrFBcUQ">announcement</a>. Most notably, the student project duration has been halved (175 hours instead of 350). Adapting to this new timeline, CERN-HSF is proposing this year shorter projects having well-defined deliverables.</p>

<p>The selection process in our organization was split in two phases. All candidates had to pass pre-selection evaluation tests prepared by mentors, demonstrating the skills needed for the respective projects. The successful candidates had a detailed exchange with mentors on a given project idea, and their proposals were evaluated for the final student selection. The detailed <a href="/activities/gsoc.html#timeline">timeline</a> of these phases is shown below.</p>

<p>The blog posts made by our 2021 students are available <a href="/gsoc/2021/blogs.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="for-students">For Students</h3>

<p>If you are interested in the HSF projects, please start by having a look at our <a href="/gsoc/students-guideline.html">guidelines for students</a>.</p>

<p>New projects for HSF GSoC in 2021 will be published by <strong>February 19</strong>. Meanwhile you can take a look at last year’s HSF GSoC <a href="/gsoc/2020/index.html#projects-in-2020">projects</a> since many of those may also propose subjects this year. The student application period will begin on <strong>March 29</strong>, but discussions about student project ideas with mentors will take place starting on <strong>March 9</strong>, when the list of accepted Organizations is announced. You are encouraged to monitor this website in order to get acquainted with our projects and be prepared for contacting their mentors. Due to the high number of applicants for CERN-HSF projects, the application period procedure become more formal this year, so please try to follow our guidance.</p>

<p>Please avoid having the first contact with the mentors of HSF projects before <strong>March 9</strong> or after <strong>March 20</strong>! You are encouraged to take the time to read our project proposals until <strong>March 9</strong>, focusing on only one or two projects that attract your interest. Once you have identified those, you should e-mail the respective mentors, attaching your CV and describing the motivation for your choice. The mentors will first propose an evaluation test, waiting for your solution. Note that the test you are given is private, your solution should be personal and the response time is part of the evaluation. Mentors will let you know the test results, and if you passed they will start discussing and helping you develop a project idea. The student application period is <strong>March 29 - April 13</strong>, when you will have to write and review your proposal with help from your mentors.</p>

<p>For further information, feel free to contact the HSF GSoC admins or join our open chat channel below. Note that the channel is intended for exchanging with the admins, the other candidates and some of the CERN-HSF students from previous year, and we do not maintain a mailing list for candidates. Please avoid posting extended information about yourself in the chat channel and reserve this for the direct exchange with the mentors.</p>

<h3 id="for-projects-and-mentors">For Projects and Mentors</h3>

<p>Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found <a href="/gsoc/guideline.html">here</a>. The main differences compared to last year are that proposals have to be tuned for 175-hour project length, and the target objectives must be well-defined deliverables.</p>

<p>We have a mentor-only Google group where we handle all announcements related to GSoC for our HSF Umbrella Organization. Please write us a mail to <a href="mailto:hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com">hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com</a> if you want to add your preferred email to this list. Note that all participating mentors in 2021 HSF GSoC will have to be added to this group. Please let us know if for some reason your want your mail removed from this list.</p>

<p>For new HEP-related groups wishing to join HSF GSoC umbrella rather than being independent organizations: there is no formal procedure, you will just need to add a description and logo for your organization. Note that your project needs to have some connection with high-energy physics to join us. We need one contact person for each new group, so please write us an e-mail.</p>
