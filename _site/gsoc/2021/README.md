## To add a new proposal

* Create a file `proposal_YOURPROJECTyourproposal.md` (look at this example: [`proposal_ROOTspark.md`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/master/_gsocproposals/2018/proposal_ROOTspark.md)). The following sections are strongly suggested:

* Under `## Description` write the description of the proposal in the context of your project. Try not to make it exhaustive, but rather readable and appealing for potential students. Note that the project duration has to be tuned for 175 hours projects (rather than 350, as in the previous years)

* Under `## Task ideas` enumerate the main ideas for the tasks to be completed for the project to succeed. Keep in mind that the target is a summer student who is not familiar with your project who will be working for 175 hours. Try to make these tasks on realistic and concrete, targeting your project main objectives - your future student will write a proposal with a plan of work built-up upon these.

* Under `## Expected results` enumerate the main objectives that you want to achieve at the end of the summer project to consider the student work successful. It is important to have a realistic and concrete target rather than generic and non-measurable objectives.

* Under `## Evaluation Tasks` give pointers to the information needed by potential candidates to complete the tests required for being allowed to submit a proposal for your project. Do not write a direct link to the tests here, give this only to the students who expressed interest in your project. It is acceptable that in this section you only write the type of test (e.g. C++ algorithm), but you can be more specific if you need to.

* Under `##Requirements` add all the mandatory skills you expect for completing the project

* Under `##Mentor` add the main mentor and at least one more-co-mentor. It is required that a co-mentor is able to replace the main mentor in case of absence and is able to fill the reports required during the program. Add only the names and the e-mails here. Mark the main mentor in bold. The main mentor is responsible for filling up the evaluation forms and exchanging with the admins.

* You should give useful links for the candidates to be able to understand better your project in case they are interested.
