    [The Institute for Particle Physics Phenomenology](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk) at Durham University is UKâ€™s national centre 
    for particle phenomenology, researching the properties and behaviour of the most fundamental building 
    blocks of nature. Since it has founded, IPPP has grown to become one of the largest particle phenomenology 
    groups in the world. Our research sits at the interface between theoretical particle physics and experiments 
    ranging from particle colliders to gravitational wave detectors.
