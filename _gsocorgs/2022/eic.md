  The [Electron-Ion Collider (EIC)](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/) will be a particle accelerator
  that collides electrons with protons and nuclei to produce snapshots of those particles’
  internal structure—like a CT scanner for atoms. The electron beam will reveal the arrangement 
  of the quarks and gluons that make up the protons and neutrons of nuclei. The force that 
  holds quarks together, carried by the gluons, is the strongest force in Nature. The EIC will
  allow us to study this “strong nuclear force” and the role of gluons in the matter within and
  all around us.
