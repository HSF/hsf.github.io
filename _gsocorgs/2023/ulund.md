  [Lund University](<https://particlephysics.physics.lu.se>) is one of the largest universities in Sweden. In the Division of Particle Physics, we work on the construction, operations, maintenance and upgrades of our experimental installations. Our researchers are members of the ATLAS and ALICE Collaborations at CERN, but we also have a leading role in the LDMX experiment at SLAC. The necessity to process very large amounts of research data using modern computational methods lead to the emergence of e-Science, which refers to research and creation of dedicated scientific computer and software solutions, and we are among the leading contributors to e-Science solutions for Particle Physics..
