  The [University of Manchester](<https://www.manchester.ac.uk>) is a leading UK research university. We have a large [particle physics group](<https://www.hep.manchester.ac.uk>) with contributions to LHC experiments, dark matter, flavour, neutrino and muon experiments. We also carry out research into new detector technologies and new data acquisition strategies for future experiments. We are also involved in distributed computing for LHC experiments, hosting one of the largest and most successful Tier-2 distributed computing centres in the UK.
