  The [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) is a leading UK research university based in Scotland's largest city. We work on [particle physics experiments](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/physics/research/groups/particlephysicsexperiment/) from the LHC to neutrinos, particle theory from interpretations of Higgs and top-quark measurements to the strong force, and high-performance distributed computing.
