  [Cornell University](http://cornell.edu) is a private and statutory Ivy League research university in Ithaca, New York. Founded in 1865, the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledgeâ€”from the classics to the sciences, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's founding principle, a popular 1868 Ezra Cornell quotation: "I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."
