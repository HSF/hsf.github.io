  The [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/en/) in Munich is one of the world’s leading research institutions for particle physics. Here, scientists study the smallest building blocks of matter and how they interact. Theory and experiment work hand in hand. The physicists at the Institute develop and test theoretical models as the basis for experiments with the aim of solving the mysteries of the universe: for example, what dark matter consists of and why antimatter no longer exists.
