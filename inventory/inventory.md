# Community Projects

The HSF helps to compile an inventory of community software projects.

If you know of a particularly useful or critical software package then
please let us know about it, by contacting the appropriate
[Working Group Convenors]({{ site.baseurl }}/what_are_WGs.html) or
[HSF Steering Group](mailto:hsf-steering@googlegroups.com).
