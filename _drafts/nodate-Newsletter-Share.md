One of the aims of the HSF is to give you and your project a forum for exchange. 
For sharing ideas we set up the open *HSF technical notes*. 
And to help you sharing your software with others we had a closer look at possible 
open source licenses.

## HSF technical notes
[HSF technical notes](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/content/technical-notes), 
or TN in short, are a possibility to share ideas, concepts, or results of discussions.
They are meant to be informal and inclusive. And can contain any topic you may find relevant
for the HSF community. The very first HSF TN explains this in detail: 
[HSF Technical Notes policy](https://github.com/HSF/documents/tree/master/HSF-TN/2015-01).

## Open Source Licenses
One of the complex, and always postponed questions is - what license should I use for my software?
Unfortunately it is not as easy as just saying - "well, it's open source!". 
There are many considerations when choosing a license, but the two main questions are:

  * what do you want others do to or not to do with it?
  * what other software do I want to take advantage of while developing it?

One technical note discusses this in detail and should help you finding the right open source
license for your project. **TODO**: add reference
