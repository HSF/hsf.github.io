The HSF had a workshop at SLAC's Kavli Auditorium in January 2015, Tue 20 - Wed 
21, with discussions continuing on Thu 22. The main goal of the workshop was to 
refine the next steps for building the HSF. The workshop was successful in 
this, with about 100 participants (80 local and 20 remote) contributing to 
establishing a concrete set of community mandated activities for the HSF. 
Several workshop summaries presented around the community are attached to this 
page. The list of registrants is available on the workshop website linked 
below.

Pre-workshop solicitation for input: Since we are stressing the bottom-up style 
of the HSF initiative by asking the opinion and suggestions to the whole 
community,  you are also encouraged to submit a contribution proposal using the 
[abstract submission 
page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/357737/call-for-abstracts/).

The [agenda](http://indico.cern.ch/e/HSFWorkshop2) is available.  In outline 
the program is:

 * Survey briefly what has been done so far (previous workshop, startup team, 
White Papers synthesis, startup plan, etc.)
 * Invite a range of large and small projects to briefly express their views on 
how the HSF could be useful to them, and what they can bring to it
 * Invite a wide range of experiments, small communities, individual users to 
express their views in lightning talks
 * Discuss new project initiatives which might be launched under the Foundation 
umbrella
 * Hear national, agency and institutional views
 * Come to consensus and conclusions on the next steps in starting up the HSF.
