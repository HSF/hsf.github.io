We are happy to announce the next installment of the Software Technology
R&D Forum, with a real technology highlight and speaker gem.

We managed to secure Kirk Shoop (Microsoft), the author of rxcpp, an
implementation of the [ReactiveX](http://reactivex.io) "approach". This
is a data-driven way of concurrent processing, leveraged for instance by
Netflix. Some see it as the language-independent destination of all
concurrency efforts, after we gave up on dealing with low-level entities
like tasks and futures.

After his [Computing Seminar](http://cseminar.web.cern.ch/cseminar/2017/0309) (which will be recorded
but not webcast) he offered a workshop-style session to discuss how to
cast existing algorithms into the ReactiveX approach, with rxcpp as an
example. Apart from his presentation, we would like to expose him to
challenges from our environment and see how well ReactiveX maps to this.

You are cordially invited to bring those challenges with you, for
instance by a two-slides presentation. Please contact the organizers if
you volunteer to expose your concurrency / data processing challenges!

The session is scheduled for *Thursday March 9, 17:00* GVA time (NOTE
the unusual day and time due to speaker availability). At CERN, the
physical location will be 32-1-A24; see
[https://indico.cern.ch/event/614559/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/614559/) for slides and Vidyo.

Best regards,

Axel with Peter and Jerome.
