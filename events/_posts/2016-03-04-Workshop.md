The HEP Software Foundation had its first formative workshop at SLAC in
January 2015. That workshop led to the establishment of HSF activity areas in
the topics of greatest community interest identified at the workshop, with an
organization following the model of a community-driven "do-ocracy". Since then,
these activities have developed and new opportunities present themselves.

The HSF will hold its second workshop **May 2-4 2016 at LAL in Orsay**, near
Paris (France). [LAL](http://www.lal.in2p3.fr/?lang=en) have kindly volunteered
to host, assuring us of another fine venue. Registration is open with all the
logistics/travel information:
[https://indico.cern.ch/e/HSFWorkshop2016](https://indico.cern.ch/e/HSFWorkshop2016).
The program will have two main elements. The first element will be a plenary
gathering with talks and discussion on progress to date and future plans, how to
garner greater participation, new initiatives and projects, and guest speakers
from the open software community. The second element will be a select number of
focused mini-workshops and hackathons, in areas of current or potential HSF
activity that are of broad interest and relevance, with hands-on objectives. The
‘do-ocracy’ part of the program.

Workshop content and topics have not been finalized, we would like your input in
order to do that, but a
[working-draft](https://indico.cern.ch/event/496146/timetable) program is here,
together with a [doodle poll](http://doodle.com/poll/8hpxredhnci2i8xh) to
quickly collect your input. Registration is open and logistics have been
established. **Please register!**
