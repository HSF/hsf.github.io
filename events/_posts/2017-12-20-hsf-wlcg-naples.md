The HSF and WLCG will hold a joint workshop that addresses the challenges
identified by the [Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/cwp.html)
process. The workshop will focus on the long term evolution of 
software and computing in HEP, particularly oriented towards
the High Luminosity LHC, the Intensity Frontier and 
new experiments in the future.

The preliminary agenda and further details, including travel and hotel 
information are now available on the [indico page](https://indico.cern.ch/event/658060/){:target="_naples_ws"}.

There will be common plenary sessions, focused on the main 
challenges for HEP described in the CWP, and parallel sessions to 
discuss and define concrete R&D projects.

There also will be ample scope for additional community driven topics. 
Please [contact us](mailto:WLCG-HSF-Workshop-2018-organisation@cern.ch)
if you are interested in using one of the reserved slots and to organise 
a session dedicated to a particular topic.

Registration will open at the end of January as we are still exploring 
sponsorship for the workshop. We will send another email with updated 
information by mid-January.
