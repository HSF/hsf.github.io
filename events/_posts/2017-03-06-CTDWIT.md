The [2017 Connecting The Dots / Intelligent Tracker Workshop ](https://ctdwit2017.lal.in2p3.fr)
takes place from 6th to 9th of March at LAL-Orsay (close to Paris).
With the parallel progress in pattern recognition algorithms and microelectronic technology, the design and performance of tracking detector is rooted in the solid interplay of hardware and software : sensors, readout and trigger electronics, online and offline reconstruction software. The main focus of the workshop is on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms devoted to the reconstruction of particle tracks or jets in high energy physics experiments, and the hardware developments that enable them.

This 2017 edition is a merger of the Connecting The Dot series with the Workshop on Intelligent Tracker series.
