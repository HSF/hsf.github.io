The
[2017 Connecting The Dots / Intelligent Tracker Workshop ](https://ctdwit2017.lal.in2p3.fr)
takes place from 6th to 9th of March at LAL-Orsay (close to Paris). With the
parallel progress in pattern recognition algorithms and microelectronic
technology, the design and performance of tracking detector is rooted in the
solid interplay of hardware and software : sensors, readout and trigger
electronics, online and offline reconstruction software. The main focus of the
workshop is on pattern recognition and machine learning algorithms devoted to
the reconstruction of particle tracks or jets in high energy physics
experiments, and the hardware developments that enable them.

This 2017 edition is a merger of the Connecting The Dot series with the Workshop
on Intelligent Tracker series.
