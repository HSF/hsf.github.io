The HSF and the LPCC are happy to announce a
[joint workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/751693/) on computing and
software challenges for event generators.

This event will focus on the challenges for physics event generators that need
to be faced in HEP in the next decade, many of which were identified in the
[HSF Community White Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982).

Many physics searches will require enhanced precision, calling for generators
which are both more compute intensive and have a larger spread of weights.
This, coupled with an increasingly heterogeneous and concurrent processing
landscape, poses serious technical challenge for much of the generator code
and calls for a rethinking of how to best use precision event
generator predictions.

The workshop will review the current and projected computational needs of the
experiments for generating the MC samples they need to achieve their physics
goals, and the plans and concerns of several generator teams, with the aim of
identifying the most crucial areas where technical and organisational
improvements are needed.

We aim to identify a programme of work that can be used to attract investment
and focus effort in these technical areas, aiming to have software engineers
who can work together with the generator authors, improving the current codes
and making new theoretical advances easier to implement in a computationally
efficient way. We will try to find areas where experiments can work together
to use event generator codes more efficiently.

The workshop is open to all interested parties, from the experiments and the
theory community, but in particular to those who write and maintain the
generator codes, from the major experiments and to experts in software
engineering in HEP.
