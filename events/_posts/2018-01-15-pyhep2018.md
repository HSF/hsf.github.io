We are pleased to announce a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HEP Software Foundation. The **PyHEP** "Python in HEP" workshops aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, will be held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/). It will focus on a review of where and how Python is used in our community, and what the future will hold.
The workshop will be a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper](/activities/cwp.html). There will be ample time for discussion.

The agenda will be composed of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:

1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 versus 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

The preliminary agenda will soon be available on the workshop indico page linked from the [PyHEP homepage](/activities/pyhep.html){:target="_pyhep"}.

Further information will be provided via the above link and also as part of the forthcoming CHEP bulletins.
