We are pleased to announce a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HEP Software Foundation. The **PyHEP "Python in HEP" workshops** aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, will be held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/){:target="_chep2018"}. It will focus on a review of where and how Python is used in our community, and what the future will hold.
The workshop will be a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/cwp.html){:target="_cwp"}. There will be ample time for discussion.

1. Historical perspective and overview
