Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments over the next 10 years will require the HEP community 
to address a number of challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the computing models will need to evolve and 
that a significant “software upgrade” is required. 

The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has been working since January on a Community White Paper (CWP) that 
will define a roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s. After the [initial 
workshop](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/) at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), 
many topical working groups have been formed to discuss the various aspects of the CWP.

This [HSF workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/613093/overview) at LAPP (Annecy, France) will conclude the work of these WGs and prepare the final 
CWP. The agenda will be a mix of plenary sessions to share the work done so far by the 
WGs and parallel sessions to finalize the work in each WG. The work of each WG is public: 
see [HSF web site](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html) for details.
