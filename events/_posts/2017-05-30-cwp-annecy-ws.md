Realizing the physics programs of the planned and/or upgraded HEP experiments
over the next 10 years will require the HEP community to address a number of
challenges in the area of software and computing. It is expected that the
computing models will need to evolve and that a significant “software upgrade”
is required.

The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has been working since January on a Community
White Paper (CWP) that will define a roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D
for the 2020s. After the [initial workshop](http://indico.cern.ch/event/570249/)
at the San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC), many topical working groups have
been formed to discuss the various aspects of the CWP.

This [HSF workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/613093/overview) at LAPP
(Annecy, France) will conclude the work of these WGs and prepare the final CWP.
The agenda will be a mix of plenary sessions to share the work done so far by
the WGs and parallel sessions to finalize the work in each WG. The work of each
WG is public: see
[HSF web site](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html) for
details.
