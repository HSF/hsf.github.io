# Working Groups

Working Groups are ad-hoc formed groups of people interested in tackling a problem together. 
If you want to form a working group or want to put some community-wide activity under the umbrella of the HSF,
just contact the [HSF startup team](mailto:hep-sf-startup-team@googlegroups.com) and we will announce your activities here.

Currently the following working groups are active within the HSF:

<ul class="list">
{% for post in site.categories.workinggroups %}
  <li> <a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
{% endfor %}
</ul>
