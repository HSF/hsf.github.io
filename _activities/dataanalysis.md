Building on previous work, the Data Analysis Activity Area aims to eliminate
the time spent by physicists working on monotonous and laborious tasks while
performing physics analysis, and to make the publication of physics results
efficient both in terms of human and computing resources.

To this end, the group will prioritise capturing the requirements of physics
analysis across the HEP domain, aiming to gain a detailed understanding of the
needs of physicists by direct consultation. Participation of those people
actively involved in writing data analysis software, especially those with
experience of publishing several analyses, will be critical to the group’s
success.

As a close second priority, the group will work with pioneers of technology,
both inside and outside of the HEP community. The goal is to build bridges
between physics analysis experts and technical innovators, fostering
collaboration between these two communities to produce optimal solutions to a 
well-defined set of problems.
