## Introduction

[Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations.

Particle physics is an exciting field where large collaborations of scientists collect
and analyze petabytes of data from high-energy physics experiments, such as the Large Hadron Collider,
hosted at the CERN laboratory in Geneva, Switzerland.
Some of the questions that we collectively ask are:

- what are the fundamental blocks that make up our Universe?
- what is the nature of dark matter and dark energy?
- what is the nature of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter?
- what was early Universe like?

To answer these questions, particle physicists build software to simulate and analyze what happens in particle physics detectors.

The CERN software for experiments (CERN EP-SFT) group has participated in the GSoC since 2011. Since 2017 the program has expanded to involve the high-energy physics community under the umbrella of the HEP Software Foundation.

Information from last year’s GSoC can be found [here](/gsoc/2019/index.html).


### GSoC 2020

In 2020 HSF is participating in the program as a GSoC umbrella organization. Project proposals are listed [below](#projects-in-2020).

### For Students

If you are interested in the GSoC program, please start by having a look at our [guidelines for students](/gsoc/students-guideline.html).

New projects for HSF GSoC in 2020 will be published in February. The application period will open in mid-March, but discussions about application ideas with mentors will take place the month before. You can monitor our website in order to get acquainted with the projects you are interested in and to be prepared for submitting an application.

For further information, feel free to contact the HSF GSoC admins:

[hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com)

### For Projects and Mentors

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here](/gsoc/guideline.html).

We have a Google group where we handle all future announcements related to GSoC for our HSF Umbrella Organization. Please write us a mail to [hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com) in case you are interested to add your preferred mail to this list. Note that all 2020 HSF GSoC mentors will have to join this group.

For new HEP-related groups wishing to join HSF GSoC umbrella rather than being independent organizations: there is no formal procedure, you will just need to add a description and logo for your organization. We need however one contact person for each new group, so please write us an e-mail.
