# Google Summer of Code 2017

## Introduction

[Google Summer of Code 2017](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/) is a program that allows students to contribute to development of open-source projects, mentored by participating organizations. CERN-SFT participates in GSoC since 2011. This year the program has been expanded to involve the wider high-energy physics community via the HEP Software Foundation.  

Students interested in participating in the GSoC can find project proposals [here](#Projects).

HSF GSoC Administrators: Sergei Gleyzer <a href="mailto:sergei@cern.ch">sergei@cern.ch</a> and Enric Tejedor Saavedra <a href="mailto:etejedor@cern.ch">etejedor@cern.ch</a>

Instructions for participating projects and mentors can be found [here]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/guideline.html).


## Projects

{:.table .table-hover  .table-striped}
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/rootlogo.png" width="100" alt="ROOT"> | A modular scientific software framework. It provides all the functionalities needed to deal with big data processing, statistical analysis, visualisation and storage. It is mainly written in C++ but integrated with other languages such as Python and R. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_ROOT.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/tmva_logo.gif" width="100" alt="TMVA"> | TMVA is a ROOT-integrated toolkit for multivariate classification and regression analysis. TMVA performs the training, testing and performance evaluation of a large variety of multivariate methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_TMVA.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/geanttiny.gif" width="100" alt="Geant4"> | Geant (for GEometry ANd Tracking) is a platform for "the simulation of the passage of particles through matter," using Monte Carlo methods. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_Geant4.html)|
| <img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/CMS-Color.gif" width="100" alt="CMS"> | [CMS](http://cms.web.cern.ch/) (Compact Muon Solenoid) is a high-energy physics experiment at the LHC. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_CMS.html)|
| **SixTrack** | [SixTrack](http://cern.ch/sixtrack) is a software for simulating and analysing the trajectory of high energy particles in accelerators. It has been used in the design and optimization of the LHC and is now being used to design the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) upgrade that will be installed in the next decade. [List of proposals]({{site.baseurl}}/gsoc/project_SixTrack.html) |

## Participating Organizations
