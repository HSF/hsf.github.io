The Detector Simulation Activity Area considers approaches to making
detector simulation faster and more accurate for HEP experiments.
Simulation that produces a traditional digitised detector output, as
well as more radical approaches to generate reconstruction or analysis
level outputs directly are within the remit of the group. Improvements
to physics models, faster particle transport options and using machine
learning and other approximate techniques can be considered. The
adaption of simulation techniques to modern computing hardware
(covering, e.g., multithreading, vectorisation and different accelerator
technologies) are an important area of work.

The group's meeting page is [in Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10916/) and
discussions are held on the [hsf-simulation](https://groups.google.com/g/hsf-simulation) list.
