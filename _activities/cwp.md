# A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

In 2017 the HEP Software Foundation produced a
[roadmap white paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982){:target="_cwp_roadmap_arxiv"} on the
software and computing challenges that will be faced during the next decade.

**The CWP Roadmap can still be signed by members of the community who endorse
it.** Please use contact the
[CWP Ghost Writers](mailto:hsf-cwp-ghost-writers@googlegroups.com?subject=CWP Signature) to add your name.
We very much encourage you to do this, to show the breadth of the community's support
for the roadmap.

## Community White Paper Reports

The roadmap summarised reports from fourteen working groups who studied the challenges in their
sub-domains. All of the reports produced during the Community White Paper process are listed below.

## History

A [historical page](../cwp/cwp-history.html) is maintained that describes in more detail
the process that the community took to arrive at the final outcome.
