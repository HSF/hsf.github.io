- Tamás Gál (Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics, Erlangen-Nurenberg, Germany)
- Alexander Moreno (Universidad Antonio Nariño, Ibagué, Colombia)
- Uwe Hernandez Acosta (Center for Advanced Systems Understanding, Görlitz, Germany)
- Pere Mato (CERN, Switzerland)

All coordinators can be reached at <hsf-juliahep-organisation@googlegroups.com>.
