# PyHEP "Python in HEP" Series of Workshops

The **PyHEP workshops** are a new series of workshops initiated and supported by the HSF
with the aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.


## PyHEP 2018

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, will be held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, the weekend just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/), i.e. on July 7-8 2018. It will focus on the review of where and how Python is used in our community. The workshop will also be a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper](/activities/cwp.html). There will be ample time for discussion.

The agenda will be composed (exclusively) of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:

1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 versus 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

Note that there won't be any training session nor hackaton in this first workshop.
Some level of (brief) training will come in small bites in the various presentations,
which will try and be educative, not just informative, with well-defined examples relevant to the topics under discussion.
In a future PyHEP workshop training and/or hackathons will be considered in connection with the HSF planning as far as cross-experiment training is concerned.
