The PyHEP Activity Area brings together a community of developers and users of Python in Particle Physics, with the aim of improving
the sharing of knowledge and expertise. It embraces the broad community, from HEP to the Astroparticle and Intensity Frontier communities.

# Conveners

* Eduardo Rodrigues (LHCb, University of Liverpool)
* Jim Pivarski (CMS and IRIS-HEP, Princeton)
* Matthew Feickert (ATLAS and IRIS-HEP, University of Wisconsin-Madison)
* Nikolai Hartmann (Belle II, LMU Munich)

All coordinators can be reached at <hsf-pyhep-organisation@googlegroups.com>.

# Getting Involved

Everyone is welcome to join the community and participate, contribute, to the organised meetings
and by means of the following communication channels:

* [Gitter channel PyHEP](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP){:target="_pyhep_gitter_channel} for any informal exchanges.
* [GitHub repository of resources](https://github.com/hsf-training/PyHEP-resources){:target="_pyhep_resources_repo"},
  e.g., Python libraries of interest to Particle Physics.
* PyHEP Workshop Twitter handle: [@PyHEPConf](https://twitter.com/PyHEPConf)

Extra Gitter channels have been created by and for the benefit of the community:

* [PyHEP-newcomers](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP-newcomers){:target="_pyhep_newcomers_gitter_channel} for newcomers support (very low entry threshold).
* [PyHEP-fitting](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP-fitting){:target="_pyhep_fitting_gitter_channel} for
discussions around fitting.
* [PyHEP-histogramming](https://gitter.im/HSF/PyHEP-histogramming){:target="_pyhep_histogramming_gitter_channel} for discussions around histogramming.
* [mpl-hep](https://gitter.im/HSF/mpl-hep){:target="_mpl_hep_gitter_channel} for Matplotlib proposals related to Particle Physics.

# Group Activities

* PyHEP **topical meetings "Python Module of the Month"** - [agendas](https://indico.cern.ch/category/11412/).
  These meetings follow the idea of the [Python 3 Module of the Week](https://pymotw.com/3/),
  but with a spirit adapted to our needs: presentations with a focus on libraries relevant to data analysis in Particle Physics, either from the Data Science domain or HEP domain specific.
* **Annual PyHEP workshops**, see details below.

The meetings are since 2020 recorded and all videos are available as [HSF YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/c/HEPSoftwareFoundation/playlists).

# PyHEP Series of Workshops

The **PyHEP workshops** are a series of workshops initiated by Eduardo Rodrigues and supported by the HSF
with the aim to provide an environment to discuss and promote the usage of Python in the HEP community at large.

## PyHEP 2024 & PyHEP.dev 2024

Two events will again be held this year:

PyHEP 2024, on July 1‒4, is a continuation of the free, online, workshop series, which has been bringing
Python HEP developers and physicists together these past years.

PyHEP.dev 2024 is intended for Python HEP software developers to plan a coherent roadmap and make priorities for the upcoming year. It will be held in-person in Aachen (Germany), on August 26‒30.
It will include presentations by participants, but the focus will be on birds-of-a-feather style group discussions.
Attendance is limited to 50 participants.

## PyHEP 2018

The first workshop, **PyHEP 2018**, was held as a pre-CHEP event in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 7-8 July 2018, just before the start of the [CHEP 2018 conference](http://chep2018.org/). It focused on a review of where and how Python is used in our community, and what the future will hold.
The workshop was a forum for the participants, representatives of the community, to discuss topics around the areas of work identified in the HSF [Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/cwp.html). There was ample time for discussion.

A keynote presentation on [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/){:target="_pyhep2018_jupyterlab"}
was given by Vidar Tonaas Fauske.

The [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/694818/){:target="_pyhep2018_indico"} was composed of plenary sessions dedicated to the following topics:

1. Historical perspective and overview
2. PyROOT and Python bindings
3. HEP python software ecosystem
4. Distribution and installation
5. Analysis frameworks
6. Python 2 and 3
7. Open discussion on education and training

There were no training sessions nor hackathons in this first workshop,
but some level of tuition came in small bites in the various presentations,
which tried to be educative, not just informative, with well-defined examples relevant to the topics under discussion.
One of the goals of this PyHEP workshop was the identification of training workshops or hackathons the community would like to have in the future.
