## Mandate and Goals

The Reconstruction and Software Triggers Activity Area considers
approaches and solutions to common challenges across HEP in the area of
event reconstruction and software triggering (e.g., algorithms and data
structures designed for online and offline processing of raw detector
data). The group targets challenges identified during the CWP
process as well as new ones arising as the state of R&D advances. This
forum should foster collaboration on design and implementation
challenges, the adoption of common approaches, and raise awareness of
existing solutions known to the community. Topics of interest include
the evaluation of new foundational libraries; techniques for track and
calorimetric-object reconstruction and identification; pattern
recognition and clustering; new approaches, including applications of
machine learning techniques and real-time analysis techniques; the
effective use of modern computing hardware through threading,
vectorisation and use of accelerator technologies; and the application
of profiling and quality assurance toolkits.
