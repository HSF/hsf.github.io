## CWP Roadmap

The [Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/cwp.html){:target="_cwp"} process, that the HSF launched in
[San Diego]({{ site.baseurl }}/newsletter/2017/02/01/CWPWorkshopSanDiego.html){:target="_cwp_sandiego"} in January 2017
came to a successful conclusion
at the end of last year, with the publication of *A Roadmap for HEP Software and
Computing R&D for the 2020s* to [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982){:target="_cwp_roadmap_arxiv"}.

Motivated by the huge challenges of the next decade, particularly for the HL-LHC, the roadmap
covers the whole of the HEP computing workflow, from event generation through simulation, reconstruction
and analysis. The document also discusses our grid infrastructure components
and the vital glue of data management and security. For each area, work that the community
should invest in to succeed in the future has been identified.

The CWP process engaged hundreds of experts in the field and has helped to forge new links between
people working in different experiments and in different regions who had not previously worked
together. This is reflected in the degree of support we have in the community, with more that 270
authors from more than 100 institutes. You can still sign the Roadmap - just send an email to
the [CWP Ghost Writers](mailto:hsf-cwp-ghost-writers@googlegroups.com?subject=CWP Signature) to lend
your support to this important document.

## HSF/WLCG Workshop

Now that we have concluded the roadmap, the next thing to do is to start working on all the
interesting projects that we have identified. To that end WLCG and the HSF are joining forces
to hold a [joint workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/658060/overview){:target="_naples_workshop"}
this Spring in Naples,
focused on our future software and computing developments.

Registration for the workshop is open now (try to book your hotel early as it's just before Easter).
We have a great programme covering many areas that we need to work in, from data lakes to
simulation, passing through the future of concurrency and a special session on how
we tackle the training needs of the community.

Feel free to suggest ideas for other sessions, or to make a contribution to existing ones
by [contacting the organisers](mailto:WLCG-HSF-Workshop-2018-organisation@cern.ch).

## Google Summer of Code, 2018

The HSF is once again [participating]({{ site.baseurl }}/activities/gsoc.html){:target="_gsoc"}
in the Google Summer of Code event. Project proposals are been actively solicited
[right now]({{ site.baseurl }}/gsoc/guideline.html){:target="_gsoc_proposal"} . This is a great
way to get talented students involved in our software projects for HEP and to
raise awareness of the HSF.
