As promised in our last newsletter, we would like to update you on some more activities of the HSF.

## Common Track Reconstruction Software Forum

Earlier this month, tracking software experts from the various experiments met to give a nice overview of the various software solutions that exist and to discuss possible common work. If you are interested in all the details, the agenda and minutes can be found [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/459865/). Further follow up meetings are planned. 

## HSF Logo Contest

It is time for the HSF to have a logo! We are looking forward to receiving your ideas. Be creative! Use the Christmas break and prepare a contribution. If you are willing to contribute, look at the [details](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/logo_contest.html).

## The HSF Packaging Working Group

One of the problems that has been solved too many times in our community is how to *build, package and distribute* the huge software stacks of our collaborations. In fact we aren't alone in re-doing this work over and over again. Many competing projects are around in the open-source community. But is this actually necessary?

To understand this in our field, a few volunteers gathered together and created the [**HSF Packaging Working Group**](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/2015/11/04/packaging.html).

Up to now we met seven times (see below) and had a look at the various existing implementations. In total we looked at 7 HEP and 2 other open-source solutions. The question was: do we really need to use so many different implementations or are there good reasons for using so many solutions? We started collecting our findings. This resulted into a [technical note](https://github.com/HSF/documents/blob/master/HSF-TN/2016-03/HSF-TN-2016-03.pdf).

In summary, it was soon clear that both requirements and solutions are similar. There is obviously no silver bullet among the existing tools that makes every collaboration entirely happy. However, we found a way to increase knowledge sharing between the experiments' librarians. It is still a long way to make this actually happen, but something has started.

Looking forward to your contributions and ideas!
