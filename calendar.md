The HSF [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com){:target="_hsf_calendar"}
can be edited by people in the [HSF Coordination Team](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-coordination)
or in the [HSF Calendar Editors Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-calendar-editors) Google Groups.

The most straight forward way to do this is to 

- go to your [Google Calendar page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar)
- select *Other Calendars* -> *Add by URL*
- add the [following URL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics)

```
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
```

Then you will have the ability to view events in the community 
calendar and, if you are in an editing group, add them. 

Please ask to join one of the editing groups if you would like to add events
for your experiment or community.
