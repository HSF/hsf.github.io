The HSF [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com){:target="_hsf_calendar"} <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->
can be edited by people in the following Google Groups:

- [HSF Steering Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-steering)
- [HSF Activity Area Conveners](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-wg-conveners)
- [HSF Calendar Editors Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-calendar-editors) Google Groups.

The most straight forward way to do this is to 

- go to your [Google Calendar page](https://calendar.google.com/calendar)
- select *Other Calendars* -> *Add by URL*
- add the [following URL](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics) <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

```sh
https://calendar.google.com/calendar/ical/e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com/public/basic.ics
```

Then you will have the ability to view events in the community calendar and, if you are in an editing group, add them.

Please ask to join one of the editing groups if you would like to add events
for your experiment or community.
Events in HSF Activity Area Indico categories should be synced automatically.
