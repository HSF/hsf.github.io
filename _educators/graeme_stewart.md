Hi! I'm Graeme and I have been involved in the HSF since the very early days. I am also a member of the [ATLAS collaboration](https://atlas.cern/). I am currently one of the main HSF Coordinators, so I try to look after a bit of everything, but I try and focus my creative and development time on [tools](/workinggroups/toolsandpackaging.html), [training](/workinggroups/training.html) and [detector simulation](/workinggroups/detsim.html).

I am a strong supporter of efforts to increase diversity in HEP and science.

In case you are wondering about my avatar, my daughter drew the cat picture for me (thanks Eilish!).
