  [Allpix Squared](https://cern.ch/allpix-squared) is a free and open-source simulation framework for silicon tracker and vertex detectors written in modern C++. The goal of the Allpix Squared framework is to provide a complete and easy-to-use package for simulating the performance of detectors from incident ionizing radiation until the digitization of hits in the detector chip.
