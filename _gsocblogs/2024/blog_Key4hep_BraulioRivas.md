intro: |
  Incorporated new features for eede (EDM4hep Event Data Explorer). Added a whole new set of collections that eede can visualize (according to the EDM4hep event
  data model) like Clusters, ParticleId or Tracks. Included visualization of relations between them and the previously developed collection MCParticle. Built a menu
  that allows users to filter out these objects according to their properties and tested using data from FCC events.
