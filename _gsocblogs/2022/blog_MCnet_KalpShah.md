## Introduction

This project aims to make the process of performing any form of modification to the simulated collider events a much simpler one. Examples of such changes include slicing, converting, merging, splitting, and any combination of such processes.

The scope of the project changed during the middle, and implementation of a pileup tool was added to it. It is a tool that generates signal events superimposed with min-bias events, resulting in an event-generator-level approximation to the presence of pileup in high-luminosity collisions.

## Work Done

It was decided to split the modification toolkit as a collection of small python programs that perform a particular task which can then be used together for performing a combination type process. Till the mid-evaluation, the functions that are implemented are the following :

- Conversion of file formats
- Slicing out the top n events from a HepMC3 file, equivalent to the `head` command
- Slicing out the top n events from a HepMC3 file, equivalent to the `tail` command
- Cutting out any range of particles from a HepMC3 file 
- Merging of different HepMC3 files to a single file

On the other hand, progress on the pile up tool was made. The tool is called pilemc which was previously a C++ tool last updated in 2015.

The pilemc code is written in python, which allows for adding pileup to a signal file. The following feaures were implemented :

- A memory efficient event finder is used which first seeks the event and then sends the event to the main pilemc code
- As the event has to be composed using the signal vertex and particles combined with the pile-up vertex and particles. Thus, a custom event composer is required which combines them into a single event which can then be added to the output file
