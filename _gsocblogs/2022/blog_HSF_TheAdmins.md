intro: |
  Student blogs are mandatory for CERN-HSF starting with GSoC 2022 edition! This is now common practice and it is an efficient way to track the activity within the different GSoC projects. For students: consider this your own GSoC page. You should publish all relevant information about the activity: links to proposals, presentations, reports, and also your experience with GSoC.

Student blogs are mandatory for CERN-HSF starting with GSoC 2022 edition! This is now common practice and it is an efficient way to track the activity within the different GSoC projects. For students: consider this your own GSoC page. You should publish all relevant information about the activity: links to proposals, presentations, reports, and also your experience with GSoC. 

Your experience is invaluable for future GSoC candidates and for improving the program every year. There are some guidelines for publishing your blogs using the [HSF GitHub repository](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io).

### Size and content

We are still experimenting this year, so there are no formal rules. The idea is that we offer a one-page placeholder that can be used for a short project description and links to all relevant materials. Some links are mandatory, such as the link to your project proposal and the links to the GSoC reports that you have to provide in the program. Few things to consider: the size of inlined text should not be exhaustive for readability reasons, and links should not point to temporary pages. 

### Making a pull request for your blog

 * Fork git [repository](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io)
 * Add __gsocblogs/YEAR/blog_YOURPROJECT_JaneDoe.md_
 * Add a front matter, using the labels as below
 * Commit to your fork and make a pull request, asking a review from your mentor(s)
