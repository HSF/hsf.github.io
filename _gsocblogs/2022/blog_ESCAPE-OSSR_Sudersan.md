### Project Brief

Several physics communities with disciplines ranging from astronomy to particle physics use the Zenodo platform to publish digital research artefacts such as research papers, software, and datasets. Often researchers face difficulties in configuring the repositories for their use. This project seeks to eliminate that by building a JupyterLab extension that retrieves the required repository from Zenodo and automatically configures it in the JupyterLab interface


### Timeline

## Community Bonding Period

The community bonding period was the first phase of the Google Summer of Code. During the community bonding period, I got the opportunity to interact extensively with my mentors and learn more about the ESCAPE ecosystem, OSSR, and the Zenodo framework. I also got the opportunity to interact with the OSSR team and see its functioning. 

## Week 1 (Coding period)

During the first week of the coding period, I worked to set up the development environment, learn from existing plugins and build 
sample extensions that mirror the required functionality. I also worked to construct an UI wireframe of the plugin.

## Week 2 (Coding period)

During the second week of the coding period, I worked to built the frontend part of the Jupyter lab extension.
