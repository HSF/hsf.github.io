  This blog is about my experiences and what I learned during my GSoC project, which involved adding a new math backend to algebra-plugins, to make Acts faster.

Hi everyone! Since starting this year, blogs are mandatory for all CERN-HSF contributors, I decided to take this time to make my own blog. I have written about my journey extensively there. Do [give it a visit](https://wermos.github.io/blog/)!

I have broken down the midterm project report into multiple blog posts:

The [first blog post](https://wermos.github.io/blog/gsoc/gsoc-first-blog-post/) discusses what GSoC is in general, for those who might just stumble upon my blog by happenstance.

The [second blog post](https://wermos.github.io/blog/gsoc/gsoc-the-details-of-my-project/) delves into the technical details about what my project actually is, what repository I would be working with, mentions our weekly meeting schedule, and describes my three mentors.

The [third blog post]() finishes up the trilogy by exhaustively discussing the work up till now, including benchmarking data and conclusions, and the current direction of the work.

That's all for now, but I hope to keep continuing writing about my journey. I hope you enjoyed reading my content!
