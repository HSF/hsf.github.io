# Logo contest

It's time the HSF had a logo, so we're holding a contest. Put your creativity to work and send your proposals to the HSF startup team. 

## How to submit

To facilitate things, we offer two possibilities:

* you upload your proposed logo to [http://it.wikitolearn.org/Main_HSF_Page/Some_proposals_for_the_HSF_logo](http://it.wikitolearn.org/Main_HSF_Page/Some_proposals_for_the_HSF_logo)
* you can submit your proposal by e-mail to:
  * dario.menasce@cern.ch
  * riccardo@kde.org

## Deadline

The deadline for submission is April 18th 2016.

After the deadline there will be a community-wide vote on selecting the best logo: people will vote using a site
specifically setup for this purpose, whose URL will be circulated at the end of the submission period.

## Voting period

The voting site will be open between April 19th, 2016 and May 6th, 2016.
Any vote cast outside this allowed time interval will be discarded.

## Our wish list for valid submissions

In addition to your idea for a great looking logo, there are a few technical conditions we suggest to make your contribution useful to the community:

  * The logo has to be in a scalable, non-raster, vectorform (PDF/SVG/EPS),
  * The logo should work both in coloured and monochrome representations,
  * We would need versions of it in different aspect ratios allowing different usages (like top-banners, side-banners, etc),
  * Size or just color variations of the same picture will be grouped under a single
image for voting purposes.
  * Nice-to-have - but not a requirement - is making the original file you used for creation of the logo available.

Finally, we would like to put - at least a variant of - the logo under a free license, so that other projects can use it to denote a connection with the HSF. Similar to the concept of the *open use logo* of the Debian project.

Looking forward to your ideas!
