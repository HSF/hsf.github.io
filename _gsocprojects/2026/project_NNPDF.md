  The [NNPDF collaboration](https://nnpdf.mi.infn.it/) determines the structure of the proton using contemporary methods of artificial intelligence. A precise knowledge of the so-called Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs) of the proton, which describe their structure in terms of their quark and gluon constituents, is a crucial ingredient of the physics program of the Large Hadron Collider of CERN. The NNPDF projects includes tools for DGLAP evolution: [EKO](https://eko.readthedocs.io), grid interpolation: [PineAPPL](https://nnpdf.github.io/pineappl/), and the fitting framework [nnpdf](https://docs.nnpdf.science)
