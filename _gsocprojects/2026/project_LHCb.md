description: |
  [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) is one of the four major experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, dedicated to precision studies of heavy-flavor hadrons in order to investigate CP violation and rare decays, and to search for physics beyond the Standard Model. The experiment employs a highly specialized forward spectrometer optimized for high-precision measurements of particles produced in proton-proton collisions. In the context of the LHCb Upgrade II, the experiment will operate in a high-luminosity environment, placing stringent demands on detector performance, real-time reconstruction, and advanced software-based reconstruction techniques.
