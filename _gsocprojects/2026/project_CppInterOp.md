description: |
  [CppInterOp](https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp) is a C++ interoperability library based on LLVM and Clang that provides compiler-as-a-service capabilities for seamless cross-language integration, leveraging the Clang-REPL interpreter for incremental compilation. Building on years of research in interactive C++ and automatic bindings generation, CppInterOp formalizes a stable, backward-compatible API that enables dynamic languages to harness the full power of modern C++ without sacrificing expressiveness or performance.​
  These primitives also enable cppyy, an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, as well as interactive C++ notebooks with xeus-cpp, bringing the speed and efficiency of C++ to simpler, more interactive languages like Python
