    The [GreenMetaData](https://github.com/GreenAlgorithms/GreenMetaData) project aims to standardise the reporting of the environmental impact of computational research. 
    Its main outcome is is a machine-readable file format that can be used to report the carbon footprint and other sustainability metrics of computational research projects. The format is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing researchers to include additional information as needed, and is complemented by online tools to facilitate impact calculation and their reporting.
