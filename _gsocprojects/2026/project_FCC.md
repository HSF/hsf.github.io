  The [Future Circular Collider](https://fcc.cern/) (FCC) is a proposed
  next-generation particle accelerator at CERN for the post High Luminosity
  Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) era, aiming to push the boundaries of
  particle physics into the late 21st century. It envisions a new roughly
  91-kilometer circular tunnel — nearly four times the size of the LHC — located
  deep underground near Geneva, spanning the border between Switzerland and
  France. The project is planned in two distinct stages: the FCC-ee, which will
  collide electrons and positrons, followed by the FCC-hh, a proton-proton
  collider capable of reaching collision energies of approximately 100 TeV.
