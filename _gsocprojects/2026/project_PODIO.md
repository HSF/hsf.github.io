  [PODIO](https://github.com/AIDASoft/podio), or plain-old-data I/O, is a C++ library to support the creation and handling of data models in particle physics. It is based on the idea of employing plain-old-data (POD) data structures wherever possible, while avoiding deep-object hierarchies and virtual inheritance. This is to both improve runtime performance and simplify the implementation of persistency services.
