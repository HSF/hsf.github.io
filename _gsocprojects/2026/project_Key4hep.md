  The [Key4hep](https://cern.ch/key4hep/) project provides an
  experiment-independent, turnkey software stack for future colliders such as
  the FCC, ILC, CLIC, CEPC, EIC, and the Muon Collider. It is characterized by
  the use of the EDM4hep data model (generated via PODIO), the DD4hep detector
  description toolkit, and the Gaudi event processing framework.
