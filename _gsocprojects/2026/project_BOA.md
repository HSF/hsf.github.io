    [Bytewise Online Autoregressive (BOA) Constrictor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11337) is a new streaming-capable lossless data compressor built upon the Mamba machine learning architecture. BOA combines an autoregressive Mamba model for next-byte prediction with a parallelised streaming range coder, and it is showing promising results in terms of data compression for high energy physics datasets. At the moment BOA is only a proof-of-principle, and we would love help in turning it into a viable tool that can be used in production.
