  [HEP-CCE](https://www.anl.gov/hep-cce) The High-Energy Physics Center for Computational Excellence (HEP-CCE) is a DOE High Energy Physics (HEP) program supported under CompHEP to address the development and implementation of HEP scientific applications on next-generation computing, storage, and networking systems. Activities under HEP-CCE maintain strong ties to DOE Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) facilities and R&D efforts. A current focus of the HEP-CCE is to develop common strategies to efficiently run HEP software applications on pre-exascale and exascale high-performance computing systems that will shortly be deployed at ASCR computing facilities.
