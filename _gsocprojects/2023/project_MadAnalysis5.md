    [MadAnalysis 5](https://github.com/MadAnalysis) is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle 
    colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform sophisticated physics 
    analyses of event files such as those generated a large class of Monte Carlo event generators in a straightforward 
    and user-friendly fashion. MadAnalysis 5 comes with two modes of running. The first one, easier to handle, 
    uses the strengths of a powerful Python interface in order to implement the analysis by the mean of a set of intuitive 
    commands. The second one requires to implement the analysis in the C++ programming language, directly within the 
    core of the analysis framework. This opens unlimited possibilities concerning the level of complexity which can be 
    reached by the analysis, being only limited by the programming skills and the originality of the user. 
    MadAnalysis 5 can also be used for the recasting of existing LHC analyses. These features are documented on the 
    [Public Analysis Database (PAD)](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/PublicAnalysisDatabase), 
    together with instructions to implement new analyses.
