  [SMARTHEP](https://www.smarthep.org) is a European Training Network (ETN,  funded by the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, call H2020-MSCA-ITN-2020, under Grant Agreement n. 956086) focusing on the use of real-time analysis techniques using machine learning and heterogeneous computing architectures. SMARTHEP brings together scientists working on the trigger systems of the four major LHC experiments and specialists from computer science and industry. In this network, we work on efficient software for real-time analysis to be used in LHC experiments as well as in transport, manufacturing, and finance.
summary: |
  SMARTHEP is an European Training Network involving LHC experiments and industry. We develop efficient software and machine learning algorithms on heterogeneous computing architectures to advance real-time analysis.
