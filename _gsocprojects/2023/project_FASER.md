  The [FASER experiment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11427) is an LHC experiment 
  located in a tunnel parallel to the LHC ring and is considerably smaller and 
  low-budget compared to the titan LHC experiments such as ATLAS and CMS. 
  The experiment seeks to detect new long-lived particles that have travelled 
  half a kilometer from a LHC proton-proton collision site, escaping the 
  major ATLAS experiment undetected. The only other proton collision "background" particles 
  reaching FASER's faraway location are muons and neutrinos. 
  Evidence of a new particle, such as the hypothetical dark photon, may lead to answering 
  our most fundamental questions of the Universe such as the origin of dark matter.
