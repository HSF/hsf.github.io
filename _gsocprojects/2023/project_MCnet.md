description: |
    [MCnet](http://montecarlonet.org) is a collaboration between the developers of
    the major collision-event modelling tools used at the [Large Hadron
    Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) (LHC) and
    beyond. These codes are so-called "MC event generators", theoretical physics
    packages that perform quantum mechanics calculations and create simulated
    particle collisions. MC generators are an essential component
    of both modern particle physics experiments and theory, and provide a crucial
    bridge between those two communities. MCnet projects include both event
    generators themselves, and tools that connect them to both experiment and
    theory.
summary: |
    [MCnet](http://montecarlonet.org) is a community linking the developers of
    particle-theory simulations with experimentalists and others who use and
    make tools for analysing the simulated events. Projects may be available
    from both aspects of the community.
