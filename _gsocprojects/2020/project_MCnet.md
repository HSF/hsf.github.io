  [MCnet](http://montecarlonet.org) is a collaboration between the developers of the major collider event modelling tools used at the [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web.cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) (LHC) and beyond. These tools are so-called "MC event generators", theoretical physics packages that evaluate and sample from quantum mechanical distributions to create simulated particle collisions. MC generators are an absolutely essential component in both modern particle physics experiments and theory, and provide a crucial bridge between those two communities. MCnet projects include both event generators themselves, and tools that connect them to both experiment and theory.
