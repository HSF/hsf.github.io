description: |
  [Ceph](https://ceph.io/) is a storage platform.  It implements object storage on a single distributed computer cluster, and provides interfaces for object-, block- and file-level storage. It can be used to build cloud infrastructure and web-scale object storage. Ceph aims primarily for completely distributed operation without a single point of failure, that can be run on commodity hardware and is scalable to the exabyte level.
