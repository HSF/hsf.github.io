  [CMS](http://cms.cern/) is a high-energy physics experiment at the [Large Hadron Collider](http://home.web    .cern.ch/topics/large-hadron-collider) (LHC) at [CERN](http://home.cern/).  It is a general-purpose detector that is designed to observe any new physics phenomena that the LHC might reveal. CMS acts as a giant, high-speed camera, taking 3D "photographs" of particle collisions from all directions up to 40 million times each second. The CMS collects few tens of Peta-Bytes of data each year and processes them through Worldwide LHC Computing Grid infrastructure around the globe.
