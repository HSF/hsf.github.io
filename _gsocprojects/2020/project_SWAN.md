description: |
  [SWAN](https://cern.ch/swan) (Service for Web-based ANalysis) is a CERN service that allows users to perform interactive data analysis in the cloud, in a "software as a service" model. It is built upon the widely-used Jupyter notebooks, allowing users to write - and run - their data analysis using only a web browser. By connecting to SWAN, users have immediate access to storage, software and computing resources (like Spark clusters) that CERN provides, and that they need to do their analyses.
