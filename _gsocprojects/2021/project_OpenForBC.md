   [OpenForBC](https://hackmd.io/@gfronze/r1j6FIb9U) is a project from [INFN](https://home.infn.it/en/), the public institute for Nuclear and Subnuclear Physics in Italy. It aims at 
   developing a common software layer for effortless partitioning of modern GPUs from different vendors (NVidia, AMD, Intel) for graphical and computing applications 
   in the open-source Linux KVM environment, paving the way for the wide adoption of this approach both in the research and in the industry fields.
