description: |
  The Heavy Flavour AVeraging group, [HFLAV](https://hflav.web.cern.ch), is an inter-experiment body responsible for averages of particle physics results across experiments and laboratories. 
summary: |
  HFLAV representatives incorporate the latest results in particle physics as they are published. Measurements of the same, or related, quantities by different experiments are combined using a statistically-robust procedure, to provide a community-resource for particle physicists to refer to when planning or interpreting their measurements. Averages are published every two years, though the web-portal is of greater importance in day-to-day work. The averaging is often Python-based.
