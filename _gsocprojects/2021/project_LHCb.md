  [LHCb](http://lhcb.web.cern.ch/) is one of four major experiments at the Large HAdron Collider at CERN. Its purpose is to investigate the CP violations and to understand why there is matter in the World. This highly- customized spectrometer is used in the physics research beyond the Standard Model with high-precision measurements of particles produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions. Its curent upgrade for Run 3 is widespread and involves supdetectors, data collection systems and analysis algorithms.
