description: |
  [PSPA](https://groups.lal.in2p3.fr/pspa/) is a web application allowing to describe the different parts of an accelerator (quadrupoles,
  drift lines, accelerating cavities...) and to assign a simulation/modeling program to each component or group of components. The 
  simulation program can be one of the standard simulation program (BETA, Parmela, Elegant...) or one provided by the user. Beam and
  machine diagnostics can be collected from probes inserted at various locations.
