description: |
  [Xeus-Cpp](https://xeus-cpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) xeus-cpp is a Jupyter kernel
  for cpp based on the native implementation of the Jupyter protocol xeus. This enables users to
  write and execute C++ code interactively, seeing the results immediately. This REPL (read-eval-print-loop)
  nature allows rapid prototyping and iterations without the overhead of compiling and running separate C++ programs.
  This also achieves C++ and Python integration within a single Jupyter environment.

  Xeus-Cpp is a Jupyter kernel for C++ based on the native implementation of the Jupyter protocol [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus).
