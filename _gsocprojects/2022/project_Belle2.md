  [Belle II](https://belle2.jp/) is a particle physics experiment 
  that studies electron positron collision events produced by the
  the [SuperKEKB](https://www-superkekb.kek.jp/) accelerator
  at the [KEK laboratory](https://www.kek.jp/en/) in Tsukuba, Japan.
  It is designed to collect 50 times more data than its predecessor
  to address open questions in fundamental physics with high
  precision measurements.
