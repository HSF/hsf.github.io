  [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch/) is a toolkit for the simulation of the
  passage of particles through matter. Its areas of application include high
  energy, nuclear and accelerator physics, as well as studies in medical and space
  science. The three main reference papers for Geant4 are published in Nuclear
  Instruments and Methods in Physics Research A 506 (2003) 250-303,  IEEE
  Transactions on Nuclear Science 53 No. 1 (2006) 270-278 and Nuclear Instruments
  and Methods in Physics Research A 835 (2016) 186-225.
