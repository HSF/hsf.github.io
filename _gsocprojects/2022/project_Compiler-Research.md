  [Compiler-Research](https://compiler-research.org) -  We are a group of programming languages enthusiasts located at Princeton University and CERN. Our primary goal is research into foundational software tools helping scientists to program for speed, interoperability, interactivity, flexibility, and reproducibility.
  Our current research focus is primarily in interpretative C/C++/CUDA, automatic differentiation tools, and C++ language interoperability with Python and D.
