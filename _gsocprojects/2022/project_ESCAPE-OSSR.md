  The ESCAPE Open-source Scientific Software and Service Repository (OSSR) 
  is an open-access repository to share scientific software and services
  to the science community and enable open science. It will house 
  astro-particle-physics-related scientific software and services for data 
  processing and analysis, as well as test data sets, documentation, 
  tutorials, presentations and training activities. It will enable a true 
  multi-messengerdata-driven cooperative approach based on the FAIR
  principles, guaranteeing an open innovation environment for science 
  interoperability and software re-usage.
