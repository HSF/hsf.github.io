  The ESCAPE Open-source Scientific Software and Service Repository (OSSR) 
  is a sustainable open-access repository to share scientific software and 
  services to the science community and enable open science. It will house 
  astro-particle-physics-related scientific software and services for data 
  processing and analysis, as well as test data sets, user-support documentation, 
  tutorials, presentations and training activities.
  It will enable a true multi-messenger data-driven cooperative approach based 
  on the FAIR principle requirements and will become part of the EOSC global 
  catalogue of services. In a collaborative effort of all ESCAPE partners, common 
  and innovative approaches will be fostered. 
  The software, science tools & other services available on ESCAPE OSSR are 
  openly available to all and allow users to access multi-messenger and 
  multi-domain software to mine open-access datasets. This guarantees 
  cross-fertilisation and an open innovation environment for science 
  interoperability and software re-usage.
