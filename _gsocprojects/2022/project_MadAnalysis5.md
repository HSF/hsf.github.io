    [MadAnalysis 5](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be) is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle 
    colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in a straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics 
    analyses of event files such as those generated a large class of Monte Carlo event generators. MadAnalysis 5 comes 
    with two modes of running. The first one, easier to handle, uses the strengths of a powerful Python interface in 
    order to implement the analysis by the mean of a set of intuitive commands. The second one requires to implement the 
    analysis in the C++ programming language, directly within the core of the analysis framework. This opens unlimited 
    possibilities concerning the level of complexity which can be reached by the analysis, being only limited by the 
    programming skills and the originality of the user. MadAnalysis 5 can also be used for the recasting of existing 
    LHC analyses. These features are documented on the [Public Analysis Database (PAD)](http://madanalysis.irmp.ucl.ac.be/wiki/PublicAnalysisDatabase), 
    together with instructions to implement new analyses.
