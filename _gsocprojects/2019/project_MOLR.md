  A Modular Distributed Execution and Debugging Framework.

  Molr provides a unified way to interact (locally or remotely) with executable code in order to run it and/or debug it.
  It is possible to provide input to it and retrieve output, return values and exceptions from this.
  The reference implementation (in the molr repository) is implemented in java. 
  However, remote interaction is performed through a well defined REST API. This makes it very easy to implement 'plugins' ([Moles](#moles)) in any programming language.
