  The [Patatrack project](https://patatrack.web.cern.ch/patatrack/) is an incubator for R&D activities within the CMS collaboration aiming to use a heterogeneous computing farm starting from the upcoming Run 3 (2021-2023), with the goal to improve the physics reach of the experiment and gain the necessary expertise in view of a wider deployment during the High-Luminosity runs at the LHC.
