  The [VecGeom](http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/608/1/012023/pdf/1742-6596_608_1_012023.pdf) project aims at developing a high-performance library for geometry modelling, describing geometry in terms of 3D solid primitives. The library provides vectorized ray-solid intersection algorithms and other geometry-specific functionality that make use of fine-grained SIMD and SIMT parallelism.
summary: |
  A vectorized high-performance library usable for fast and accurate geometry computations in very complex setups.
