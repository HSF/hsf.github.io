description: |
  Detector simulation is consuming most of the High-Energy Physics computing cycles, and even so, experiments have to take hard decisions on what to simulate, as their needs surpass the availability of computing resources. It is therefore necessary to explore innovative ways of speeding up simulation in High-Energy Physics.
  
  The [GeantV](http://geant.web.cern.ch/) R&D project aims at developing a high performance detector simulation system
  integrating fast and full simulation that can be ported on different computing architectures, including accelerators.
