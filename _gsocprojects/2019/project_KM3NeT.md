description: |
  [KM3NeT](http://www.km3net.org) is a research infrastructure housing
  the next generation neutrino telescopes. Once completed, the
  telescopes will have detector volumes between megaton and several
  cubic kilometres of clear sea water. Located in the deepest seas of
  the Mediterranean, KM3NeT will open a new window on our Universe,
  but also contribute to the research of the properties of the elusive
  neutrino particles. With the ARCA telescope, KM3NeT scientists will
  search for neutrinos from distant astrophysical sources such as
  supernovae, gamma ray bursters or colliding stars. The ORCA
  telescope is the instrument for KM3NeT scientists studying neutrino
  properties exploiting neutrinos generated in the Earth's
  atmosphere. Arrays of thousands of optical sensors will detect the
  faint light in the deep sea from charged particles originating from
  collisions of the neutrinos and the Earth. The facility will also
  house instrumentation for Earth and Sea sciences for long-term and
  on-line monitoring of the deep sea environment and the sea bottom at
  depth of several kilometers.
summary: |
  A large deep-sea research infrastructure that houses two
  next-generation neutrino telescopes in addition to instrumentation
  for Earth and Sea sciences.
