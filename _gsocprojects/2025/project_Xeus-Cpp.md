  [Xeus-Cpp](https://xeus-cpp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a Jupyter kernel
  for C++ based on the native implementation of the Jupyter protocol [xeus](https://github.com/jupyter-xeus/xeus).
  It provides users with an interactive execution environment for C++ in Jupyter notebooks, built on LLVM's
  [Clang-Repl](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangRepl.html) C++ interpreter, provided by
  the [CppInterOp](https://github.com/compiler-research/CppInterOp/) interoperability library. 
  
  This REPL (read-eval-print-loop) nature allows rapid prototyping and iterations without the overhead
  of compiling and running separate C++ programs, allowing users to write and execute C++ code interactively.
