description: |
  [Cppyy](https://cppyy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an automatic, run-time,
  Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from
  C++. Run-time generation enables detailed specialization for higher
  performance, lazy loading for reduced memory use in large scale projects,
  Python-side cross-inheritance and callbacks for working with C++ frameworks,
  run-time template instantiation, automatic object downcasting, exception
  mapping, and interactive exploration of C++ libraries. cppyy delivers
  this without any language extensions, intermediate languages, or the need
  for boiler-plate hand-written code.
