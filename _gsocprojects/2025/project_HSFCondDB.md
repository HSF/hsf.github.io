description: |
  In high-energy physics (HEP), conditions databases play a critical role in managing non-event data. 
  This includes calibration constants, alignment parameters, and detector conditions, which evolve over time. 
  These databases ensure that analysis software can access the correct calibration and alignment data corresponding to 
  the detectorâ€™s state at any given time, enabling accurate physics measurements.
  
  The [HEP Software Foundation](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) (HSF) proposes a Conditions Database reference 
  for HEP and Nuclear Physics experiments around the world. Several experts have converged on a common design for 
  conditions data access management [arXiv:1901.05429](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05429). 
  The [nopayloaddb](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/nopayloaddb) is an implementation of this reference. It has been 
  successfully operating within the [sPHENIX](https://www.sphenix.bnl.gov/) experiment for nearly two years 
  and is currently being adopted by [Belle II](https://www.belle2.org/). Additionally, other collaborations, including 
  [ePIC](https://www.bnl.gov/eic/epic.php) and the [Einstein Telescope](https://www.et-gw.eu/), have expressed interest 
  in evaluating its suitability for their needs.
summary: |
  The [Nopayloaddb](https://github.com/BNLNPPS/nopayloaddb) is an implementation of the HSF  
  Conditions Database reference, an experiment-agnostic design for conditions data access management.
