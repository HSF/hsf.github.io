description: |
  ML4EP is a project of the CERN [SFT group](https://ep-dep-sft.web.cern.ch) focused on developing common machine learning (ML) software tools to support HEP experiments. The current  ongoing activities are:  
  - Designing  generic generative ML models for fast simulation of calorimeter showers
  - Developing ML software for efficient inference in C++, such as [SOFIE](https://root.cern/manual/tmva/#sofie) and creating interfaces between external provided ML software and HEP software like [ROOT](https://root.cern)
  - Building tools for ML inferfence in FPGA like [hls4ml](https://fastmachinelearning.org/hls4ml/)
  - Developing common libraries for model compression and quantization, facilitating optimized ML workflow and porting of ML HEP applications in a real time environment.
