description: |
  [Constellation](https://constellation.pages.desy.de/) is a
  control and data acquisition system for small-scale experiments and
  experimental setup with volatile and dynamic constituents such as testbeam
  environments or laboratory test stands. Constellation aims to provide a
  flexible framework that requires minimal effort for the integration of new
  devices, that is based on widely adopted open-source network communication
  libraries and that keeps the required maintenance as low as possible.
