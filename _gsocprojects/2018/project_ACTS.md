  [ACTS](http://cern.ch/acts) is a free and open-source software project for track reconstruction in high-energy physics experiments. As a modernized version of the particle tracking code used by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, the project is focused on adoption of modern C++ standards, usability in multi-threaded workflows, and increased use of vectorization and accelerators (gpgpu).
