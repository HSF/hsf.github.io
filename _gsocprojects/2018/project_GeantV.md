description: |
  Detector simulation is consuming at least half of the High-Energy Physics computing cycles, and even so, experiments
  have to take hard decisions on what to simulate, as their needs greatly surpass the availability of computing resources.
  Since computing resources will not increase at best, it is therefore necessary to sustain the progress of High-Energy
  Physics and to explore innovative ways of speeding up simulation.
  
  The [GeantV](http://geant.web.cern.ch/) project aims at developing a high performance detector simulation system
  integrating fast and full simulation that can be ported on different computing architectures, including accelerators.
