# Machine Learning Forum

The Inter-Experimental LHC Machine Learning Working Group
[IML](http://iml.cern.ch) has been launched recently. The group is focused on
the development of modern state-of-the art machine learning methods, techniques
and practices for high-energy physics problems. The group provides solutions,
software and training beneficial for all LHC experiments as well as a forum
where on-going work and relevant issues are discussed by the community.

## Goals

- Develop & sustain MML4HEP expertise â€“ it is not just about software, but need
  ML know-how & insights, e.g.
  - which algorithms to use for which problem
  - how to tune hyperparameters
  - how to deal with non-continuous or missing variables
  - Troubleshooting, novel applications, data vs. MC,...
- Series of dedicated LHC ML challenges to further strengthen & grow MML-HEP
  interaction, so we can more effectively collaborate
