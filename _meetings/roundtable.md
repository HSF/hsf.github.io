The *Software and Computing Roundtable* is a general series of meetings on topical
matters for the nuclear and high-energy physics community, which is organised
jointly by Jefferson Lab, Brookhaven National Lab and the
HEP Software Foundation.

The Roundtable has historically had particularly strong links to the nuclear
physics community, but is now expanding to be the perfect meeting point
with high-energy physics.
