The *Compute Accelerator Forum* is a series of meetings on topics
related to the effective use of compute accelerators in the HEP
field.

The CAF is organised by SIDIS, openlab and the HSF.

It comprises a variety of topics, ranging from:

- abstraction layer toolkits and general libraries
- HEP software projects that use accelerators
- particular topical issues that affect multiple projects

The schedule for past and future meetings is published in
[Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/).

meetings. Announcements of these meetings, in particular, are
