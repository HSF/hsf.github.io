The *Compute and Accelerator Forum* is a series of meetings on topics related to
HEP computing hardware and software.

The CAF is organised by openlab and the HSF.

It comprises a variety of topics, ranging from:

- abstraction layer toolkits and general libraries
- HEP software projects that use accelerators
- particular topical issues that affect multiple projects
- new processing architectures
- programming language developments, from the new languages to new standards

The schedule for past and future meetings is published in
[Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/).

You can contact the [organisers](mailto:compute-accelerator-forum-organizers@cern.ch)
to suggest any topics that you would like to see in future
meetings. Announcements of these meetings, in particular, are
sent to the
