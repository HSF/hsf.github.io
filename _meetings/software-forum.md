The *HSF Software Forum* is a general series of meetings run occasionally by the community aimed at:

* Raising awareness of software projects that are of common interest.
* Discussing areas of that could benefit from new projects.
* Hearing from other communities that share some of the challenges and interests of the HSF.

It is usually used when a meeting doesn't fit into one of the current working group
areas or meeting series.

The meeting schedule is in [Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/10392/){:_target="HSF_Software_Forum"}.

[Suggestions](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com) for any future meeting topics are always very welcome.
