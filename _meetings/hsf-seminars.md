HEP Software Foundation Seminars are a regular series of monthly meetings for
the field (usually held on the last Wednesday of a month). The HSF Seminars are
focused longer form meetings and allow plenty of time for discussion on the
subject material.

Of particular interest are domain areas in HEP, e.g., event generators,
simulation, reconstruction and analysis. However, all interesting topics are
eligible!

The schedule for past and future meetings is published in
[Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).

You can contact the [HSF Steering Group](mailto:hsf-steering@googlegroups.com)
or any of our [activity area]({{ site.baseurl }}/) coordinators to suggest or
volunteer any topics that you would like to see in future meetings.
