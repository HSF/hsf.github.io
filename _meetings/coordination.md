The HSF has regular coordination meetings, usually held once
every two weeks, on odd weeks of the year.

The meetings are open to everyone interested in the HSF's activities
and are used to review the planning for future events, pass on
items of interesting news or to discuss new HSF activities.
Minutes are regularly published on this website.
