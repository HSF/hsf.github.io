# Description

MadAnalysis 5 is a framework for phenomenological investigations at particle
colliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in
a straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of
event files such as those generated by a large class of Monte Carlo (MC) event
generators. MadAnalysis 5 comes with two modes of running. The first one, easier
to handle, uses the strengths of a powerful Python interface to implement the
analysis utilizing a set of intuitive commands. The second one requires
implementing the analysis in the C++ programming language directly within the
core of the analysis framework. This opens unlimited possibilities concerning
the level of complexity that can be reached by the analysis, which is only
limited by the programming skills and the originality of the user.

Validation is an essential ingredient of software development. The current
testing and validation structure of MadAnalysis relies on legacy code that is
executed on private servers. Only a fraction of the validation process has been
implemented to be run on GitHub. We want to extend this, and implement a
separate function-based testing environment which can be executed within
GitHub's CI/CD workflow. This project will allow the contributor to learn an
essential ingredient of software development through the creation of a
GitHub-based testing module which can work efficiently and effectively within
the CI/CD workflow. This project will involve the identification of functions
that need testing, the creation of an efficient module taking into account the
limited resources provided by GitHub, and the deployment of validated software.

## Task ideas

This project will target the design of a `C++` based unit test module and its
execution of this module within the GitHub workflow. We therefore expect
contributors to have a good understanding of C++ unit tests and some working
knowledge of GitHub's CI/CD workflows.

## Expected results & Milestones

- Learning how MadAnalysis 5 works.
- Identifying functions that needs to be tested.
- Creating individual unit tests for every function that has been identified.
- Preparing CI/CD workflow for unit test.

## Requirements

- Strong C++ skills
- Python
- Strong knowledge on Git and GitHub (especially CI/CD workflows)
