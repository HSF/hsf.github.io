## Description

xeus-clang-REPL is a C++ kernel for Jupyter notebooks using clang-REPL as its C++ Interpreter. Cppyy is an automatic, run-time, Python-C++ bindings generator, for calling C++ from Python and Python from C++.

Allowing C++ and Python to talk between themselves in a Jupyter notebook will allow users to switch between Python and C++ at will. This means that data analysts can set up their analysis in Python while running the actual analysis in C++. Thus reducing the time to write and debug their analysis pipeline.

Initial support of cross talk between the two kernels has been implemented (see here) but this only supports passing primitive data types. This project aims to use Cppyy to extend this to support classes and functions.

## Project Milestones

* Automate creation of equivalent Cppyy objects in the Python kernel when objects are created in the C++ kernel
* Automate the creation of equivalent C++ objects in the xeus-clang-REPL kernel when Python objects are created
* Add documentation


## Requirements

* C++ programming
* Python programming
