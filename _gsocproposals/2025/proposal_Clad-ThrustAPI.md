## Description

The rise of ML has shed light into the power of GPUs and researchers are looking for ways to incorporate them in their projects as a lightweight parallelization method. Consequently, General Purpose GPU programming is becoming a very popular way to speed up execution time.

Clad is a clang plugin for automatic differentiation that performs source-to-source transformation and produces a function capable of computing the derivatives of a given function at compile time. This project aims to enhance Clad by adding support for Thrust, a parallel algorithms library designed for GPUs and other accelerators. By supporting Thrust, Clad will be able to differentiate algorithms that rely on Thrustâ€™s parallel computing primitives, unlocking new possibilities for GPU-based machine learning, scientific computing, and numerical optimization.

## Expected Results

* Research and decide on the most valuable Thrust functions to support in Clad
* Create pushforward and pullback functions for these Thrust functions
* Write tests that cover the additions
* Include demos of using Clad on open source code examples that call Thrust functions
* Write documentation on which Thrust functions are supported in Clad
* Present the work at the relevant meetings and conferences.

## Requirements

* Automatic differentiation
* C++ programming
* Clang frontend
