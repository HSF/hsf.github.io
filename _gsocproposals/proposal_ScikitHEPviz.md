## Description
The Scikit-HEP project is a community-driven and community-oriented project with the aim of providing the particle physics community with common tools for data analysis. An important component of this project is visualization of histograms (such as those derived from the “histogrammar” toolkit) and other results of data aggregation tools designed to handle extremely large and diverse data sets common in particle physics. This project is to develop and demonstrate tools capable of rapid and reproducible display of our scientific data building on existing toolkits such as Vega, ROOT or MatPlotLib.

## Task ideas
* Develop visualization tools that interface to SciKit-HEP data aggregation tools currently under development. Challenges include visualization of remote data (eg, via web interfaces), reproducibility and the richness of the data to be visualized. There are a number of different possible approaches to this topic.

## Expected results
A suite of demonstrator/tutorial problems based on visualization tools integrated into the SciKit-HEP toolkit.

## Desired programming experience
Advanced Python.
