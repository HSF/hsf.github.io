title: Code Benchmark and Consolidation in SixTrack
layout: gsoc_proposal
project: SixTrack
year: 2018
organization: CERN

## Project Description
Benchmark simulation size against result throughput on different architectures
and identify I/O, memory and CPU bottleneck. Evaluate the impact of merging
branches on these performance figures.

## Expected results
An analysis of result throughput depending on the architecture, identification
of bottlenecks in the source code, assessment on impact of branches.

## Mentors

  * [Riccardo De Maria](mailto:Riccardo.De.Maria@cern.ch)
  * [Kyrre Sjobak](mailto:kyrre.ness.sjoebaek@cern.ch)

## Requirements
Fortran, calculus, accelerator physics.
