# Description

High Energy Physics (HEP) analysis functions are typically written in a straightforward, procedural style, but algorithms written in this style are not always performant. Slow analysis code does more than slow down researchâ€” it breaks the concentration of the analyst. HEP can benefit from Spark-style analysis pipelining, which makes it easier to parallelize algorithms, as well as contiguous-memory and vectorization techniques from High Performance Computing (HPC). While tools to provide these features are well in development, we also need domain-specific analysis algorithms to be cast in these forms to take advantage of the new libraries. The goal of this project is to reimplement a suite of HEP functions and demonstrate the improvements possible with functional, pipelined, and vectorized approaches.

Algorithms written in a procedural style cannot be translated into a functional/pipelined/vectorized style automatically. In many cases, the logic of the analysis procedure needs to be re-thought, to compute the same quantities in a new way.

## Tasks

The proposed project would be to develop a suite of HEP analysis primitive functions that (a) can be composed as building blocks, as in a combinational library, (b) satisfies various constraints of immutability, loop independence, associativity, vectorizability, etc., and (c) reproduces the original HEP functionality.

We propose the following steps:

 * given a collection of real-world analysis scripts and explanations of their purpose, distill the common techniques into components that can be composed;
 * express these components in frameworks like [Object-Array Mapping](https://github.com/diana-hep/oamap), which allows rapid exchange between object-oriented views and vectorizable-array views of the same data, or [Histogrammar](https://pypi.org/project/histogrammar/), which builds plots by composition, or a new, similar infrastructure;
 * demonstrate that the original analysis code can be expressed as compositions of these components, hopefully reducing complexity and improving readability;
 * run performance tests on the original and re-expressed scripts, hopefully observing an improvement.

## Expected results

At the end of this project, we expect a first draft of a functional/pipelined/vectorized HEP library. We are more interested in the _way_ the successful applicant implements these functions than a polished package, as the results may be repurposed in other libraries.
