## Description

The [ROOT](https://root.cern/) is a framework for data processing, born at CERN, at the heart of the research on high-energy physics. Every day, thousands of physicists use ROOT applications to analyze their data or to perform simulations. The ROOT software framework is foundational for the HEP ecosystem, providing capabilities such as IO, a C++ interpreter, GUI, and math libraries. It uses object-oriented concepts and build-time modules to layer between components. We believe additional layering formalisms will benefit ROOT and its users.

Currently, ROOT is built as one monolithic application. We are working to create a modular version of ROOT that provides a minimal base install of core features, then later add functionality using a package manager. This requires introducing new layering mechanisms and extending the functionality of the existing ROOT package manager prototype.

For further information please read our proposal: [Proposal](https://github.com/root-project/root-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0001-modularization.md)


## Expected results
* Enhance the package manager to work with already built packages
* Teach ROOT how to communicate with its package manager
* Enhance the existing CMake build system rules to enable lazy building of packages
* Rethink the continuous integration system in term of a package-oriented system


## Requirements
C++, Python, CMake, Git, TravisCI.
