## Description

Rucio is a data management system for modern large-scale scientific experiments. It allows experiments to deal with vast amounts of data in a scalable, modular, and flexible way. Our primary instance for the ATLAS experiment orchestrated an Exabyte of data transfer and processing in 2017. To orchestrate these global transfers between data-centres, Rucio supports pluggable external transfer tools dedicated to large-scale experiments. However, especially for smaller communities the deployment and operation of such an external transfer tool involves a significant amount of operations and resources. For this reason we are seeking a motivated student to design, implement, and test a lightweight WebDAV/HTTP-based transfer tool that supports the Rucio transfertool API natively and internally. If you are interested in large-scale data management, networked systems, and open protocols then come and join our open development team and contribute to our free and open-source Github repository.

## Task idea

Development of a plugin module for the Rucio transfer system, which can enable third-party copy of files using the WebDAV/HTTP standard.

## Expected results

### Objective 1 - Setup a Rucio development environment

- We can serve either Docker-based development environments, or completely custom installations on UNIX-based systems.

### Objective 2 - Design an architecture for a lightweight WebDAV/HTTP-based transfer tool

- There are template transfer tools available to guide the student, to help with the design.
- There exists an RFC for a WebDAV/HTTP third party copy verb, which might be useful to evaluate.

### Objective 3 - Implement the lightweight WebDAV/HTTP-based transfer tool

- We can provide test endpoints to the student, to implement the transfer tool under real experiment conditions.
- Successfully enable periodic functional test in our production environment.

### Objective 4 - Report

- We host weekly collaboration meetings, and we would like that the student presents at the end of GSoC a 10 minute talk about the experience.

## Requirements

- Python
- Linux development environment (bash, git, ...)
