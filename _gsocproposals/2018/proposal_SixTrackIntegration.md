## Project Description
The SixTrack building system has been recently updated using CMake and
integrated in CDash. This enables us to implement best practices in testing by
improving the test coverage, test speed and nightly test cycles.

## Expected results
Approaching 100% code coverage with test and at the same time reducing testing
running time. Implement automatic triggers for each commit that will launch the
test suite and CDash update.

## Mentors

  * [Riccardo De Maria](mailto:Riccardo.De.Maria@cern.ch)
  * [Kyrre Sjobak](mailto:kyrre.ness.sjoebaek@cern.ch)

## Requirements
Fortran, calculus, accelerator physics.
