## Project Description
[C-Reduce](https://github.com/csmith-project/creduce) is a tool which aims to reduce 
bug reports. It transforms user's source files to make them as minimal as possible.
Minimalistic bug reproducers are easy to debug and convert into regression tests.
C-Reduce is fairly mature and well adapted to minimize crashes in compilers. The
project will be mainly focused towards making C-Reduce easier to use with ROOT and
it's interactive C++ interpreter cling.

## Task ideas and expected results

  * Extend C-Reduce to be able to reduce easily ROOT bug reports.
  * Optionally extend C-Reduce to minimize ROOT's data files.
  * Implement tests for all the realized functionality.
  * Prepare a final poster of the work and be ready to present it

## Requirements
Intermediate level of C++, some experience with Clang
