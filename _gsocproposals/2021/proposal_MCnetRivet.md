# Description

Rivet is a software package for performing data analysis on simulated particle collision events like those in the Large Hadron Collider. Analyses of real data have to deal with the effects of the giant, complex particle detectors that surround the beam interaction points, which are expensive to simulate, but use of statistical techniques allows much faster methods to be employed for testing theory models against data measurements. Rivet is the LHC's principle tool for such lightweight model testing, using events simulated using Monte Carlo (MC) methods. There are currently more than 1000 analysis routines registered on the Rivet platform.

Visualisation of Rivet's output has been performed since project inception by a set of Python scripts which generate LaTeX/pstricks graphics commands to draw axes, error bands, data series, etc. This output is high-quality and suitable for use in physics publications, but it is slow, and sometimes error-prone due to the LaTeX backend and its sensitivities to deployment platforms. This project will focus on designing and implementing a replacement for this system, based on modern rendering technologies while preserving output quality.


## Task ideas

This project will involve a mixture of system design and implementation. The ideal replacement for the existing plotting system will cast Rivet's data into a platform-agnostic format which can then be rendered for presentation via multiple frameworks, or for example in multiple styles suitable for different contexts. These target platforms will include both publication-quality and talk-quality plot styles, and Web-based interactive plotting. This data-flow will also incorporate a single coherent treatment of data combination, for example combination of multiple "variation" histograms into a single data series with a structured uncertainty band. We envisage that the first target renderer will be the Python matplotlib library.


## Expected results

 * design of a new data-flow for Rivet analysis histograms, performing semantic combinations of data objects (to create ratios, uncertainty bands, etc.), and export to multiple rendering targets with minimal code duplication;
 * building a first target renderer to publication-quality and presentation-quality matplotlib outputs, in particular handling MathText/LaTeX symbol-table completeness issues;
 * reviewing and recommending other rendering platforms for Web-based visualisation.
