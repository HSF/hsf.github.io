## Description
[Falcon](http://inspirehep.net/record/1456803) is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments. The goal of this project is to extend the falcon training and inference capability to include graph auto-encoders to improve end-to-end simulation of the detector deposits. 

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Integration of GNNs into the falcon training
  * Implementation of Graph Auto-Encoder for end-to-end simulation 
  * Integration of GNNs into the inference



## Requirements
Strong development skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
