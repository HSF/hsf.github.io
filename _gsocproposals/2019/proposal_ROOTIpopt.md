## Description
Ipopt (Interior Point OPTimizer)[1] is a software package for large-scale ​nonlinear optimization. It is designed to find (local) solutions of mathematical optimization problems.
Ipopt is now integrated to ROOT framework providing a new set of tools for minimization[2] through a ROOT plugin system in the math libraries.

## Task ideas
  * To write support for:
    * Constraint function g(x):Rn−>Rm
    * Gradient of the constraint function
    * Hessian
    * All solvers
    * Compilation under MS Windows with Visual Studio
  * Write tests for all solvers including some of then with Hessian and constrain function.
  * Measure performance comparing the current ROOT minimizers.

## Expected results
Fully integrated Ipopt with support for all solvers, hessian and constrain function. 
Documentation, tests and examples.

## Desirable Skills
  * C++ knowledge.
  * Experience with optimization problems.
  * Experience with ROOT is a plus.
