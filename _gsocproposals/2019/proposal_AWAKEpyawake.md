title: Python Analysis Package for AWAKE
layout: gsoc_proposal
project: AWAKE
year: 2019
organization: CERN

## Description

[AWAKE](https://awake.web.cern.ch/) acquired tens of terabytes of data during the 2017-2018 experimental run. The goal of this project is to develop an analysis package that runs in Python Jupyter Notebooks using CERN's [SWAN](https://swan.web.cern.ch/) service. The analysis package will include data reduction and visualization tools. The student is expected to have competency in Python.  The student will develop their coding skills and learn about the physics of plasma wakefield acceleration and data analysis during the project.

## Task ideas
 * Create a database of the AWAKE dataset and provide an API for querying the data (can use existing tools).
 * Implement a Python library that uses NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.
 * Port existing analyses into the new library.
 * Develop example notebooks that demonstrate the basic features of the library on SWAN.

## Expected results
Working implementation of a Python library that performs the core data analysis routines for AWAKE.

## Evaluation Tasks
 * Please complete the [evaluation tasks](https://github.com/awakeExp/gsoc_eval) before submitting a proposal.

## Requirements
Python, Jupyter notebooks
