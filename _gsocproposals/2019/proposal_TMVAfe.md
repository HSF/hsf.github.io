# Description

Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA) is a multi-purpose machine learning toolkit integrated into the ROOT scientific software framework, used in many particle physics data analyses and applications. In the past years we have expanded TMVAâ€™s capabilities to include various deep learning architectures: Fully-connected (DNN), Convolutional (CNN) and Recurrent (RNN) Neural Networks. TMVA currently has several filter and wrapper methods for feature extraction. The candidate will work in this area developing additional methods, completing some of the missing functionalities and integration with the deep learning modules  

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Implementation of probabilistic feature extraction methods.
  * Implementation of model-specific feature extraction methods (focus on deep learning modules).

## Requirements
C++ skills, experience with large scale software development and machine learning tools is a plus.
