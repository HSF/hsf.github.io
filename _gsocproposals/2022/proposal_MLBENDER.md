# Description
Data driven background estimation is crucial for many scientific searches, including searches for new phenomena in experimental datasets. Neural autoregressive flows (NAF) is a deep generative model that can be used for general transformations, and is therefore attractive for this application.

The MLBENDER project focuses on studying how to develop such transformations that can be learned and applied to a region of interest. 

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * Implement a Neural Autoregressive Flow (NAF) model to estimate the background distribution and apply it to a representative physics analysis searching for a resonance excess over a smooth background. 
  
## Expected results
  * Results from training Neural Autoregressive Flow model to estimate the background on a physics analysis application searching for a resonance over a smooth background.
