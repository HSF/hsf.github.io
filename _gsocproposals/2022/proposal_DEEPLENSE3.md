## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate [WIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the DeepLense pipeline that combines state-of-the art of deep learning models with strong lensing simulations based on [lenstronomy](https://lenstronomy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The focus of this project is using equivariant neural networks for classification and regression of dark matter particle candidates (e.g. CDM, WDM, axions, SIDM).

## Task ideas
 * Expand the DeepLense functionality with equivariant networks suitable for computer vision tasks applicable to DeepLense data

## Expected results
 *  Develop an equivariant deep learning model for DeepLense training and inference

## Requirements
Python, PyTorch and relevant past experience in Machine Learning.
