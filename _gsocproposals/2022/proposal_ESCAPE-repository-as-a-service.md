## Description

The [ESCAPE project](https://projectescape.eu/) is building an Open Source and collaborative 
environment in where to connect astronomy, astroparticle and particle physics project. This 
research environment is composed of the ESCAPE services. In this context, the Open-source 
Science and Service Repository (OSSR) provides a trusted repository that will be accessible 
through the ESFRI Science Analysis Platform (ESAP).

The successful candidate will be integrated into the ESCAPE project to develop a JupyterLab  
extension to create an user friendly connection between the repository and the analysis platform 
(the computing resources). This JupyterLab plugin will simplify the access to Zenodo (the Open Source 
Repository), that provides an open archive archive for scientists to share their analysis software  
and data.
