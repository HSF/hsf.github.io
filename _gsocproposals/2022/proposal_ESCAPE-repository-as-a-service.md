## Description

The [ESCAPE project](https://projectescape.eu/) is building an Open Source and collaborative 
environment in where to connect astronomy, astroparticle and particle physics project. This 
research environment is composed of the ESCAPE services. In this context, the Open-source 
Science and Service Repository (OSSR) provides a trusted repository that will be accessible 
through the ESFRI Science Analysis Platform (ESAP).

The successful candidate will be integrated into the ESCAPE project to develop a JupyterLab 
extension to create an user friendly connection between the repository and the analysis platform 
(the computing resources). This plugin will simplify the access to Zenodo (the Open Source 
Repository) that provides an open archive for scientists to share their analysis software 
and data.
 

## Task ideas and expected Results

* Create a JupyterLab extension to connect the Jupyter environment to Zenodo (the repository). 
* Participate in the development of the eOSSR library to integrate the Jupyter extension. 
* With the help of the eOSSR python library, display the repository records through the JupyterLab interface.
* Bring back the record content to the working environment using the developed plugin.
* Investigate how to install the different software records available in the repository and find solutions
to the different software languages libraries.
* Define the needed stages to publish back to Zenodo and the ESCAPE community.

The student will learn to work in an Open Science environment and will get accustomed to the open
publication process and tools. He or She will also learn about setting up a complete DevOps 
environment, developing, testing and using continuous integration pipelines in all the software lifecycles to 
provide high quality software. Code reviews and AGILE methods will be used to integrate the student and its
work in the exiting project and framework.
