## Description
[DeepFalcon](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2020/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2020_138.pdf) is an ultra-fast non-parametric detector simulation package that automatically abstracts detector response, usually done by hand in fast-simulators used by particle physics experiments. The goal of this project is to extend the current implementation of graph auto-encoders to improve end-to-end simulation of the detector deposits. 

## Task ideas and expected results
  * Extend and scale Graph VAEs to the multi-layer detectors.
	 * Test various graph connectivities, pooling etc. to optimize the performance.

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Test 
Please use this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-4baai481dNyUHBPtTUSQjBT2Qfrw4s/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=103538884238549030751&rtpof=true&sd=true) to access the test for this project. 


## Requirements
Strong machine learning skills, good knowledge of C++ and Python. Interest in Machine Learning algorithms and applications.
