## Description

State-of-the-art sequence to sequence models (seq2seq) have yielded spectacular advances in neural machine translation (NMT) (see, for example, [Ref1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.02047.pdf) ). Recently, these models have been successfully applied to  symbolic mathematics by conceptualizing the latter as  translation from one sequence of symbols to another ( [Ref2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01412) ). It is easy to imagine numerous tasks that can be construed as translations. In the proposed Gsoc project the goal is to create a tool that automatically provides an accurate symbolic representation of a histogram by construing the problem as one of translation from a histogram to a symbolic function. We call the project Fast Accurate Symbolic Empirical Representation Of Histograms (FASEROH).

## Duration

Total project length: 175 hours.

## Task ideas
  * The goal of the project is to use available seq2seq models to create the mapping between an histogram and a symbolic function. See more details [here](https://ml4sci.org/assets/faseroh.pdf).


## Expected results
  * Since this project will be a proof of principle, the seq2seq task will be limited to 1-dimensional histograms defined on the unit interval.
   
## Requirements 
Python, previous experience in Machine Learning. 

## Test

Please use this link to access the test for this project. Tests will be published in March.
