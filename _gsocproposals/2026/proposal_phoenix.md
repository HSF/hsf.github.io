## Description

The [Phoenix](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/) event display offers web based visualization of the high energy physics (HEP) events coming from various HEP experiments. It is build with the help of the angular web platform with visualizations itself done with the help of the [threejs](https://threejs.org) library. 

Phoenix was started a few years ago now, and web technologies evolve rapidly. The goal of this project is to investigate the current state of Phoenix and to propose and implement improvements that would allow it to be more easily extended and maintained in the future (bearing in mind that it is already in production use and so any impact on clients should be minimised). The project should also revist the UI and see what changes can be made to make it more modern, user friendly and intuitive. Any other technical, or ease of use improvements that can be made to Phoenix are also welcome.

## Task ideas

 * Investigate and understand the current state of Phoenix, and identify areas for improvement
 * Propose and implement improvements to the codebase, with a focus on maintainability and extensibility
 * Propose and implement improvements to the UI, with a focus on user experience

## Requirements
 * Typescript/javascript
 * (3D experience a bonus)
