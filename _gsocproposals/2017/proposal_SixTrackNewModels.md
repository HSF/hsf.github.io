## Project Description
Implement, test and put in production a new solvers for generic RF-mulitpole,
combined function magnets and radiation effects.

## Expected results
The user can build accelerator simulations with more accurate models for low
energy machines and/or machines with radiation effects.

## Mentors

  * [Riccardo De Maria](mailto:Riccardo.De.Maria@cern.ch)
  * [Kyrre Sjobak](mailto:kyrre.ness.sjoebaek@cern.ch)

## Requirements
Fortran, calculus, accelerator physics.
