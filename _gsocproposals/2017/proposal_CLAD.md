# Description

In mathematics and computer algebra, automatic differentiation (AD) is a set of techniques to numerically evaluate the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. Automatic differentiation is an alternative technique to Symbolic differentiation and Numerical differentiation (the method of finite differences).  [CLAD](https://github.com/vgvassilev/clad) is based on Clang which will provide the necessary facilities for code transformation. The AD library is able to differentiate non trivial functions, to find a partial derivative for trivial cases and has good unit test coverage. There was a proof-of-concept implementation for computation offload using OpenCL.


## Task ideas and expected results:  
 * The student should teach AD how to generate OpenCL/CUDA code automatically for a given derivative.
 * The implementation should be very well tested and documented. Prepare a final poster of the work and be ready to present it.

**Requirements**: Advanced C++, Clang abstract syntax tree (AST), CUDA/OpenCL basic math.

**Mentors**:
