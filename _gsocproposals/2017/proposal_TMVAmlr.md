# Description
[mlr](https://mlr-org.github.io/mlr/) is an [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) package that integrates almost all machine learning packages in R. [RMVA](http://oproject.org/RMVA){:data-proofer-ignore=""} is a set of plugins for TMVA based on [ROOTR](http://oproject.org/ROOT+R){:data-proofer-ignore=""} that allows the use of R in TMVA. The idea is to update the library RMVA to use mlr.

<!-- oproject is very slow and times out on html-proofer -->

## Task ideas
 * Write BaseMethod class for mlr package.
 * Implement a system to check if the required machine learning method has the R package installed.
 * Implement a system to check if the required machine learning method from R has support for multiclass classification, regression or weights in the data.
 * Write methods to support classification and regression.
 * Write a clear documentation with a table of options for every method.

**Expected results**:
 * working implementation with tests and documentation
 * A machine learning example using different methods for classification and regression.
 * Compare C50/RSVM and RSNNS using the current RMVA implementation and with the new MLR implementation.

**Requirements**: Advanced skills in C/C++, experience with R and machine learning.
