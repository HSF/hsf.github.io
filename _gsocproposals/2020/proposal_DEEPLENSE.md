## Description

Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate [WIMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weakly_interacting_massive_particles) particle dark matter from other well motivated models, including vortex substructure of dark matter condensates and superfluids.

This project will focus on further development of the pipeline that combines state-of-the art of deep learning models with strong lensing simulations initially based on [PyAutoLens](https://github.com/Jammy2211/PyAutoLens) for strong gravitational lens modeling.


## Task ideas
 * Expand the DeepLense functionality to include interfaces to additional dark matter simulation tools
 * Optimize and improve the interface to PyAutoLens
 * Expand the unsupervised modeling suite in DeepLens 

## Expected results
 * Working simulation interface to PyAutolens including its full functionality 
 * Unsupervised modeling suite 

## Requirements
Python, C++, and some previous experience in Machine Learning.
