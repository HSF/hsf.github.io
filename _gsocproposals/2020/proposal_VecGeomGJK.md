## Description

The [VecGeom][1] project aims at developing a high-performance library for
geometry modelling, describing geometry in terms of 3D solid primitives. Fast
geometry queries are crucial in high energy physics (HEP) detector simulations.
The VecGeom library provides vectorized implementations of ray-solid
intersection algorithms and other functionality that make use of fine-grained
SIMD and SIMT parallelism.

The [Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi algorithm][2] is a fast algorithm for general
convex shapes. The goal of this project is to implement the GJK algorithm in
VecGeom/Geant4 to allow for the simplification and potentially speedup of
several geometry primitives by sharing the same algorithm for their
implementation. Using a common implementation is also helpful to run simulations
on the GPU in the future.

## Task ideas

We propose the following steps:
 * Implementation of the GJK distance and ray-casting algorithms
 * Implementation of validation and performance tests
 * Performance comparison with current algorithms

## Technology
 * C++11, template programming

## Desirable Skills
 * Advanced C++ programming skills
 * Experience with numerical algorithms

## Expected results
 * Development and validation of the GJK algorithm in Geant4/VecGeom
