  [MadGraph5_aMC@NLO](https://launchpad.net/mg5amcnlo) is a framework that aims to simulate high-energy collisions for various accelerators and in particular for LHC physics. It focuses mainly on physics beyond the “Standard Model” allowing physicists to search for various scenarios in their experiments. MadGraph5 is extensively used by both theorists and experimentalists making the code one of the most cited papers every year. MadGraph5 is a meta-code written in python that generates specialised code in low-level languages (Fortran and C) to produce very fast code.
