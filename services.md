# Development Services

Both CERN and Fermilab have expressed willingness to support some development tools and services for the HSF community, once technical issues are worked out. For example, access to TechLab (link no longer available)resources at CERN. In other areas the HSF may provide guidance, recommendations, templates etc. for the use of open source tools. This group will plan and coordinate activities and service offerings in this area.

## TechLab

Probably the trickiest part is to establish a process to authenticate non-CERN people on the hosts. TechLab is prepared to work with us and early-adopter project(s) to work through the issues. They suggest an initial focus be on leveraging TechLab for performance measurements and/or energy consumption studies. </div>
