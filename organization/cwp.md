# A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s

In 2017 the HEP Software Foundation, [charged by the WLCG]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/CWP-Charge-HSF.pdf){:target="_cwp_charge"}, produced a
[roadmap white paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s41781-018-0018-8){:target="_cwp_roadmap_csbs"} on the
software and computing challenges that will be faced during the next decade.
This has been published in the journal
[Computing and Software for Big Science](https://link.springer.com/journal/41781).

### Citation

A Roadmap for HEP Software and Computing R&D for the 2020s, The HEP Software Foundation, Albrecht, J. et al., Comput Softw Big Sci (2019) 3, 7 <https://doi.org/10.1007/s41781-018-0018-8>.

We recommend you download the citation files (BibTeX and others) for the paper from the
journal website.

The roadmap is also available as [arXiv:1712.06982](https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.06982).

## Community White Paper Reports

The roadmap summarised reports from fourteen working groups who studied the challenges in their
sub-domains. All of the reports produced during the Community White Paper process are listed below.
Working groups are in the process of [finalising and uploading]({{site.baseurl}}/cwp/cwp-wg-papers.html) their work to arXiv.

## History

A [historical page]({{site.baseurl}}/cwp/cwp-history.html) is maintained that describes in more detail
the process that the community took to arrive at the final outcome.
