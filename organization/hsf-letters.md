The HSF's mission is to encourage cooperation and common projects
between all parts of the high-energy physics community concerned
with software. We span regions and experiments and we strive to
to make our community's software development more effective.
To that end, the HSF will happily cooperate with any project that
shares similar goals.

The HSF will usually give a letter of cooperation for any projects and proposals
that are aligned with the general goals of developing collaborative software for
particle physics. This will particularly apply when there may be multiple
applications for a funding stream which are well aligned with the HSF. Letters
of support are usually reserved for specific calls where there is one clearly
identified proposal from HEP.

## Letters of Cooperation

We will be happy to provide a *letter of cooperation* that can be used for any
software project or funding application, including, e.g., individual fellowships,
stating that the HSF will work with the proposer(s) if they receive funding. The
HSF can also put in this letter a statement stating that the goals of the
project are well aligned with the [Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl
}}/organization/cwp.html) and other similar documents. To ask us for this
please:

- Send a request to [HSF Coordination](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com)
- Include an outline of your project's goals and indicate where you
  believe that the HSF can usefully cooperate and work with you
  - We strongly encourage you do discuss with the working group conveners of
  the working groups where you think this would happen
  - As we will circulate this outline to the whole of the HSF be aware that this
  will, *de facto*, become a public document
- Please make this request at least *two weeks* before you need the letter

## Letters of Support

If you would like a *letter of support* for your project, you are asking the HSF
to endorse your project specifically. This is usually reserved for a targeted
call where there is one application from the HEP community. Projects should be
able to demonstrate specific aims to tackle the challenges set out in the
[Community White Paper]({{ site.baseurl }}/organization/cwp.html).

- Send a request to [HSF Coordination](mailto:hsf-coordination@googlegroups.com)
- Include an outline of your project's goals and indicate in what way
  this helps the high-energy physics community to meet the software challenges
  of the future
  - Outline in which way you would with in and with the HSF during the project
  - As we will circulate this outline to the whole of the HSF be aware that this
    will, *de facto*, become a public document
- Please make this request at least *three weeks* before you need the letter

## Procedure

In both cases the HSF Coordination group and the HSF Working Group Conveners
will discuss the request and, if approved, circulate a draft letter and the
project outline **to the whole of the HSF community** for any comments. We will
then approve the request in an HSF Coordination meeting (or, exceptionally, just
by email, should deadlines not fit with the meeting schedule).
