## Purpose

The [HSF YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HEPSoftwareFoundation) is used to
host video content that should last beyond the lifetime of a single event and
for which it is useful for people to be able to view the material 'offline'.

Hosting the material on YouTube is useful as the platform is optimised for
video content delivery and people can subscribe to the channel to get updates.

However, we still recommend posting the material to Indico as some people may
prefer to view it there. In particular, for all of its advantages, YouTube
pushes adverts at viewers and we also do not control the platform itself (e.g.,
though it is unlikely, we could be blocked or have videos subject to
take-down).

## Content

Good content for the channel includes:

* Sessions from HSF workshops and co-organised events
* Working Group topical meetings
* Training videos

Groups of linked videos should always be added to a *playlist*. Make sure
the playlist has a link back to the original Indico agenda so that viewers
can access associated material, like slides.

If you are not sure if something should be uploaded then if can be discussed
in an HSF Coordination Meeting.

## Management

YouTube channels have *owners* and *managers*. You need to be a manager to
upload material and create playlists. Only owners can add new managers.

The current HSF Owners are:

* Graeme Stewart <graeme.andrew.stewart@cern.ch>
* Eduardo Rodrigues <eduardo.rodrigues@cern.ch>

If you aren't able to contact an owner, please ask the 
[HSF Steering Group]({{ site.baseurl }}/organization/team.html) for advice.
