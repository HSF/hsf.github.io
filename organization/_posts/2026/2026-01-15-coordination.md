## News, general matters, announcements

Happy New Year 2026 everyone!

### 2026 conveners

The call for 2026 activity area conveners is over. We are now in the process of finalising, with several invitations sent out, and several acceptations already received! We hope to have the full 2026 team by the end of the month.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

Planned HSF seminars:
- Open Data seminar joint with IML coming up! [28th Jan](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1604475/).
    - Room at CERN booked: 42/3-032.
    - More details likely in Trig & Reco report.
- Seminar on HS3: [25th March](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1622602/)

Others in the works:
- Seminar by Kati Lassila-Perini (chair) on ICFA Data Lifecycle panel [best practice recommendations](https://icfa-data-best-practices.app.cern.ch/).
    - Format still being defined.
- 2nd in series on AI-assisted SW tools organised by Software Tools & Packaging - Feb?
- Seminar from creator of mp-units (supports units and constants in C++, see AOB) - being followed up by John Chapman. Aiming for May-July period.

(Thanks to the activity groups for coming to us with seminar ideas and speakers!)

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@googlegroups.com>.

Please send your suggestions for next seminars.

### Steering Group

No meeting held this new year since the last meeting on December 2nd 2025.

See below for news on the Affiliation programme.

### Advisory Group

- The next meeting will take place in early 2026. Date to be set soon.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

The list of affiliations is so far rather short but there is momentum, with several evaluations ongoing or on the horizon:
  - DIRAC - ongoing
  - NoPayloadDB Conditions Database - ongoing
  - Pepper - ongoing
  - MadGraph5_aMC@NLO - ongoing
  - Pythia - spontaneous interest from the Pythia collaboration (super!), we have 2 reviewers already identified

Do not hesitate to discuss around you to identify relevant projects/libraries that could engage with the affiliation programme.

Thank you very much to those who accepted to act as a "reviewer" or spontaneously put themselves forward. This is super appreciated; it makes all the difference.

## Activities Updates

### Software Training

#### Summary of 2025

- Analysis Reproducibility Training: The virtual event was held in March 2025, in async format: live kick-off and mentoring sessions, with lessons pre-recorded
- HSF/IRIS-HEP Software Basics Training: A hybrid in-person at CERN and remote training was held in June 2025, covering Bash, Python, Git, and ROOT.
- Python for Analysis Training: A session was held in December 2025, with 50 registrations

Workshops and Community Engagement

- A dedicated training session was held at the joint WLCG-HSF Workshop in May 2025, which included invited speakers and a talk on the HSF Training experience
- Hackathons were planned or held for topics like the SSH Shell and Databases (DBs) training materials.

Training Infrastructure and Documentation

- Significant progress was made on the JOSE paper on Apptainer/Containerization, including finalization of the draft, gathering of authorship information, and working on format and plots.
- The training.cern.ch (TeSS for HEP) platform went live. Contains HSF Training Center materials, and HSF trainers are encouraged to register

#### Plans for 2026

Training Events

- Analysis Reproducibility Training in 2026
  - Proposed Dates: Week of April 27 or May 4.
  - Modules: CI/CD GitHub Actions, Docker/Podman, Apptainer, CI/CD GitLab, and REANA 
- Software Basics at National Labs (Summer Schools):
  - Three full days to cover the basics: Bash, Git, Python, ROOT, and Python for analysis.
  - Locations: BNL and Fermilab, during the early days of June (start of the Summer School programs). 
- ML Training:
  - Organising for the current year, with a list of potential instructors 
  - We will call for a brainstorming meeting, develop an agenda, and collect/develop material 
- Train the Trainer:
  - Elaborate material based on our experience training basic software, aiming to train people interested in joining the training effort in the HSF, and in the experiments
  - Aiming towards the end of the year.
- 14th HEP C++ Course and hands-on training, 9 - 13 March
  - <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1617123/>
  - Registration has opened

Curriculum Development & General Goals

- Strengthen communication around training activities within the experiments.
- Finalise the work migrating our training modules from legacy styles to modern, maintainable formats (like Jupyter Book) 
- AI and LLM Initiatives. AI tools to maintain training materials. Agents find outdated information, automatically open issues, and suggest fixes, with humans reviewing and signing off. 

### Event generators

- Preparing to submit two GSoC projects on negative weight mitigation using the cell resampling technique. Envision one project to be more theory based (running cell resampling at NNLO with MCFM), the other one would be more ATLAS specific.

### Data Analysis

Nothing to report (working on first meeting for 2026) - Luke and Matthew.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

As mentioned above, the Open Data seminar joint with IML is coming up! [28th Jan](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1604475/). This goes beyond reco+trigger with the contributions from IML. Most important is to spread the word!

### PyHEP

- PyHEP.dev 2026 workshop is in planning stage.

### JuliaHEP

JuliaHEP 2026 will be in Munich. End of September or beginning of October - TBD.

JuliaCon 2026 - Mini-symposium proposal was submitted:
- JuliaHEP Mini 2026 - Julia for Nuclear and Elementary Particle Physics: From Precision Science to High-Performance Tools

We are organising JuliaHEP Users Meetings - every other month next year. TBA.

## AOB

Do not hesitate to get in touch with the SG if you have/know of events useful to add to the HSF calendar.
The calendar is used by very many to check for available dates, constraints, and plan events. Thank you in advance.

### Physical Constants / HEPdata Library

Standing reminder: we proposed a C++ header-only library that defines physical constants and some salient HEPdata in a lightweight, easy-to-use manner. Also taking into account versioning.

Please get in touch with Graeme Stewart if you would like to discuss involvement in this.

### Next Meeting

The next coordination meeting will be on January 29th, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1606599/>.
