# HSF Coordination Meeting #210, 24 June 2021

*This notebook is used to record the minutes of the HSF Coordination meetings. These are archived after each meeting onto the [HSF Website](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org).*

## Tips

- If you find you cannot edit these notes please login with your GitHub account!
- If you are adding a URL, please use `<` and `>` to make it an active link, as in `<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#autolink>`
    - Without the <>s the link is not active in Jekyll, even if it is in CodiMD
- Please use `-` to indicate lists in this file (we try to avoid mixing `-` and `*` in the same file - it's markdown lint!)
- Please use the Zoom "raise hand" if you'd like to make a comment in the meeting

## Attending

Present: Benedikt Hegner, Kyle Knoepfel, Meirin Oan Evans, Dorothea vom Bruch, Andi Salzburger, Josh McFayden, Liz Sexton-Kennedy, Michel Jouvin, Eduardo Rodrigues, Krzysztof Genser, Allison Hall, Sudhir Malik

Apologies: Graeme Stewart, Andrea Valassi,  Serhan Mete
  
## News, general matters, announcements
 
### HL-LHC Review Phase 2

Now very close to the draft documents being released on 30 June - we hope that people can free some time to read and comment.

### DUNE Framework Requirements Review

We have begun writing up the final document that will be presented to DUNE.  To aid our write-up, there have been subsequent emails (and offline discussions) with DUNE to get some clarification on their memory requirements.

Still targeting completion by end of June or shortly thereafter.

### HSF Domain Name

Still investigating this with CERN, who might want to take it over connected with the lab's Jekyll deployment.

## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis
Analysis in the wider HEP/nuclear physics community:
	- Third meeting last week (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1037201/) , featuring talks from SuperNEMO, Belle II, and an overview of HSF training activities (thanks Sudhir!) 
	- Another meeting next week (https://indico.cern.ch/event/1051980/), featuring talks from BES III (TBC), EIC, and LHCb

Analysis metadata document: 
	- Received lots of excellent feedback, which we are implementing now
	- Plan to post the finished document on Zenodo and the HSF website; should we also consider publishing it in a journal? Best candidate is probably Computing and Software for Big Science.



### Detector Simulation

Will resume meetings in late September/early October.
Several topics planned to be covered, including MARS, varying Geant4 model parameters, DD4HEP, GPU developments update.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
Topical meeting next Wednesday, June 30th, at 5 pm:
https://indico.cern.ch/event/1048211/
4D reconstruction with timing


### PyHEP
- No topical meeting until September (breaks are good and important, especially these days).
- [PyHEP 2021 workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2021):
    - Starts in 2-ish weeks on July 5th.
    - Abstracts review done. Final agenda soon to appear on Indico.

### Software Tools and Packaging



### Software Training
 

####  HEP Software Training Challenge 
Date-->Monday 28 June 2021
Time -->  4:00 PM-6:30 PM CERN time
Indico --> https://indico.cern.ch/event/1044523/ 
Goal--> In this workshop we propose to build on and expand the software training effort in the coming 3 years by defining a clear target in the form of the “Training Challenge”.

#### HSF Training Hackathon on C++
Date: Monday 5 July 2021 
Time--> 4:00PM -6:30 PM CERN time
Indico --> https://indico.cern.ch/event/1044512/
Goal-->This would focus on revisiting highly successful and sought after  C++ training, lessons learnt, progress made, modifications needed and feedback to constantly improve it. 
 

#### HEP C++ Course

- Preparing for 3rd iteration of the event. Plan to hold the course **30 Aug - 3 Sept** https://indico.cern.ch/event/1019089/ . 
- Registration for 75 places will open **Monday 28 June, 9 am CEST**. (if you are interested please be there on time, last course was "sold out" in a bit more than 2 Minutes)
- Currently we are working on adapting content and new exercises.
- **IMPORTANT**: We are **looking for mentors** for the hands-on tutorials. A mentor would usually attend 2 hands-on trainings (2 hours each) during the week and guide 5 - 10 students through already prepared exercises. Please contact the [organizers](mailto:hep-cpp-course-organizers@cern.ch). 

### Event Generators

- Meeting last week about Herwig. Meeting later today about Powheg and LHAPDF/Rivet. This probably completes our meetings before the summer. We started to ramp up rapidly on the preparation of the LHCC document (quite late with that).
    - For now Pythia8 is most advanced but still incomplete. 
- Andrea: the vCHEP proceedings on the work on MG5aMC on GPU and vector CPUs will be on arxiv tomorrow.
- LHC Top WG had a [contribution](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1009645/timetable/#4-towards-a-common-atlascms-mc) on studies towards a common MC sample for ttbar events.
    - Main focus not initially for sample sharing
    - But they are using HSF EOS space to store LHE files as part of the process.

### Frameworks

Nothing to report in addition to DUNE framework-requirements review.

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Differentiable Computing

### Quantum Computing

### Visualisation

### Event Delivery Forum

### Licensing

## AOB


### Next Meeting(s)
