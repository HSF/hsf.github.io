    -   [*Proposal googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aAGCj_y9in_I-c9yYJ-XX3Qurf0PXH4tFoYmvuCY5tk/edit?usp=sharing)

    -   If we’re going to do it we have to make concrete plans ~now. We agreed that we will do it.

    -   Liz will send out a doodle for dates. On the table are

        -   April 10 mid-week (14 Apr is Good Friday)

        -   April 24 mid-week

        -   May 22 Mon-Wed (Thursday is a CERN holiday)

    -   Where to hold it? Annecy? Lyon? EP-SFT has used a retreat location near Divonne but it only holds 50, too small. **We need a volunteer host who will be well engaged in planning the meeting.**

    -   Plan B is to have it at CERN if no one steps up to host. We will book a room at CERN as insurance, right away after the doodle.
