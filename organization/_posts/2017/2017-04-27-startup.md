## News, general matters

-   Riccardo - had the visualization meeting yesterday. First draft of CWP chapter will have writing assignments soon. Agreed on an abstract for IEEE in Oct.

## Special topic: HEP analysis ecosystem workshop agenda

-   Draft agenda [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/)

-   Agenda outline [*googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2v4W5X216sXALToBTT-jT0fFkaIQhld2cqDnSqdv-I/edit?usp=sharing)

-   We spent about 1.5 hours going session by session through the program. See the agenda outline googledoc and links therein. Key points & next steps:

    -   ‘concrete technologies’ really isn’t separable from the vision session. Join them, or link them. Turn it into ‘vision enabling technologies’ coming after the vision session? Would fit with the fact that the vision session will focus on hearing the views of many on their vision for analysis, so talking about enabling technologies coming after could fit. Will be clearer how to structure things once we have talk lists.

    -   there has been good progress on thinking about talks, some specific talk planning too. **We urgently need to capture this in a program of talks** for each session that could be used to make a first pass at a fleshed out indico agenda, and sort out session durations.

    -   **action on all: flesh out the talk list on the [*googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2v4W5X216sXALToBTT-jT0fFkaIQhld2cqDnSqdv-I/edit?usp=sharing) by Tuesday May 2** so we can use it to put together a first indico agenda by next week’s meeting

    -   **where specific talks are agreed, session conveners should proceed with invitations to speakers.** If it is not clear whether a specific talk is agreed send an email to conveners/startup team, don’t wait for the next meeting.

    -   **the next general discussion of the agenda will be in next week’s HSF meeting, again at 3pm CERN time**; session-level discussions in the meantime are welcome but please promptly transfer their outcomes to the agenda googledoc
