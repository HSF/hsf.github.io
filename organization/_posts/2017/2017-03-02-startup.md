## Current Topics

### CWP

-   Top level information page (with current known planned workshops) is: [*http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html*](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html)

-   Since last week the Visualization WG workshop (CERN and Vidyo) has been added, with Indico page

-   Additional information on the WGs is being maintained (and updated in fits and starts) on: [*http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html*](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html)

-   There were meetings this past week of the Simulation, Analysis Tools and Interpretation WGs, plus an open CMS meeting on the computing model, facilities and distributed computing topic

-   Daniel - Simulation meeting - focused on computing performance. All LHC experiments presented, also neutrino people. CMS and ATLAS said they would prepare a proposal for simu performance evaluation and monitoring, variables we want to monitor. Discussions underway, proposal expected soon. Next meeting on March 27 will focus on fast simulation.

-   Ric - Visualization workshop: [*https://indico.cern.ch/event/617054/*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/617054/). Weâ€™re building the agenda. Workshop sessions will be in the late afternoon (~17:00-20:00) so people can connect even from the Pacific Coast time zone (UCSD CMS group).

-   Software Trigger and Event Reconstruction WG session at CTD/WIT will be next week, [*https://indico.cern.ch/event/614111/*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/614111/)

-   Ian - [*whiteboard googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fDKX4WaiQg-4Z38sr3FZJm5HHFoFREBQsSfjhYJqtDc/edit#heading=h.d71sarrypd5l) to collect ideas is accumulating contributions with others promised. Next make an outline for the white paper chapter/section, at a high level, then start organizing ideas within that outline. Should materialize in the next few days.

-   CWP discussion with FNAL/SCD (at FNAL) will happen on 23 March

-   Looking for progress in other WGs, e.g. data access/management. Andy says something will be coming there.

    -   Michel - there is a WLCG Data Steering Group with a meeting last week. All the members have been encouraged to participate actively in the CWP. A pre-GDB is planned beginning of May on these issues with CWP topics (relevant to WLCG) probably at the core of the agenda.

### HEP analysis ecosystem workshop

-   [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/)

-   NIKHEF contact is iterating with venues, three possible at reasonable prices, finalizing numbers in order to choose

-   Target: announcement draft ready next week

    -   Need to decide location before!

    -   Have a blocked out agenda by then

        -   coffee at 10:30 R1 tomorrow Friday, all welcome.

## Activity updates

-   Liz - Packaging - discussed with FNAL people, planning a meeting in a couple weeks, March 15 5-6pm.

-   IEEE NSS: looks more as a training that a meta-training workshop. Not very much attractive then (not necessarily the good place for this).

-   Licensing meeting - will put out a summary soon. Also need to follow-up with Fastjet developers about Fastjet GPL licensing: need to organize a F2F meeting/chat with them (unfortunately nor Liz neither Graeme will be in Paris next week for the Connecting the Dots workshop).

## AOB

-   meeting next week
