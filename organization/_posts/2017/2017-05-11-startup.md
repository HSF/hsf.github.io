-   -   Today’s … session

    -   Difficulty to find somebody from ATLAS to report on the analysis model. Apparently an impossible task. Perhaps use plan “C” and Graeme present what ATLAS is doing. The survey got more than 200 answers from ATLAS.

    -   All the other talks are now covered by speakers. The indico agenda will be filled today or tomorrow.

    -   Liz: grandparent talk? Tom Le Compte? Perhaps somebody from the HSF startup team, or use the slot for a discussion. On what topic? Perhaps more on a history of analysis? Towards a lessons learnt.

-   Vision … session

    -   Nobody in the meeting. Pere will contact Axel.

    -   Andrea: any specific talks on spark or hadoop for instance?

-   Technology … session

    -   The talk proposals are already in the indico agenda. The titles and actual contents will be discussed with the presenter.
