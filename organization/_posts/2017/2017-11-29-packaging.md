#### [Indico Agenda and Presentations](https://indico.cern.ch/event/681894/){:target="_hsf_packaging_15"}

## Introduction
* Next meeting scheduled for [13th December 2017](https://indico.cern.ch/event/684972/)
  * Will focus on CVMFS/Containers/Deployment, with presentation from CVMFS developers.
* Graeme and Ben will draft an abstract on Packaging Use Cases/Tool Assessment for [CHEP 2018](http://chep2018.org)
  * Will present at next meeting for comments/feedback
  * Not a paper on any specific tool - expect that people will submit their own abstracts on those.
* Noted second draft of HSF White Paper open.
  * Encourage people in this WG to read and comment, especially Software Development.
  * Also for people to sign - don’t have to have contributed to the content to sign.
* Update on Use Cases Document
  * Good feedback and comments since last time, thanks to contributors!
  * Common agreement on "must have" requirements: specify build options for dependencies,
    reuse of binary artifacts, setup of runtime "views".
  * Clarification on: global build options, recipe hierarchy, install relocation (with example
    implementations), development environment.
  * Many comments are useful in their own right, so need to capture this information
    somewhere other than a Google Docs comment thread.
  * Clarifications with Giulio Eulisse on his comments
    * On sources, felt important to have a self-managed backup of third-party sources.
      Guarantees future availability, plus allowing patching. Comment from ATLAS
      that they also install package sources as part of their package/distribution
      pipeline.
    * On reducing command line options, this is to keep major things like switching
      compiler part of the recipe.
    * On recipes, importance is to ensure that older packages can be rebuilt in the future.
      E.g. in Alibuild, Alibuild as it is now can build Alibuild recipes from N years ago.
  * Clear that we need to identify "actors" in the Use Cases, e.g. librarian, end user.

## Presentation from Oana: ATLAS Releases: Build, Packaging and Deployment - short overview
* ATLAS offline code is split into many, many units of code called “packages” (usually implementing some particular classes and building a small number of libraries). The full offline Athena release has about 2000 packages.
* New way of building Athena is quite simple. LCG release is a base, then build AtlasExternals, then Gaudi, then the rest of Athena.
* Build of Athena bootstraps using AtlasSetup  (sets up gcc, cmake version etc). A few helper scripts used for building whole of Athena, or subsets - output is rpm, from CPack.
* Nightly rpms are release candidates - copied to EOS. Distribution to CVMFS via Python script. Each nightly build put into date-time tagged directories, under this are the Athena, AthenaExternals, Gaudi. LCG, Externals, tdaq are common over a range of Nightlies
* Also allow private builds to be distributed over CVMFS
* Future: looking at ways to save AtlasExternals binary artifacts. Reuse? Looking at Nexus, git LSF. Breaking up large rpms. Include build of LCG

### Discussion
* Microsoft has released [source code](https://github.com/Microsoft/GVFS) for their Git virtual filesystem (GVFS). There is a [project with GitHub to port this to Mac and then Linux](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/11/microsoft-and-github-team-up-to-take-git-virtual-file-system-to-macos-linux/). Will be a talk on this at CVMFS Workshop in January. Background: Windows source code is very large, so using a Virtual File System to only checkout files when touched.
* In ATLAS, nightlies always built from scratch both for security and to work around some issues with incremental builds seen in continuous integration. But now in a position to seriously consider incremental nightlies as well.
* Discussion on installing directly on CVMFS: Is an issue with relocatability, need to have consistent mount points, and of course a writable CVMFS repository. Currently binaries local to build machine, packaged, then uploaded to EOS.
* Nexus: can store binary artifacts, then can check existence of required binary when/if needed later. Tool to be investigated.

## Presentation from Lukas: Containers in ATLAS
* Containers and Package Managers solve related, but largely orthogonal problems
* PMs main unit of distribution is a software package with declared dependencies,
  each operation is a filesystem change. Packages interface with each other via
  low level ABIs.
* Containers main unit of distribution is an filesystem, image of which is sequence
  of package manager and other operations. Containers interface with each other via
  abstract file/REST/data server/message queues.
* Good fit in HEP: global distribution of a complex stack that uses significant OS component to a wide range of systems that we don’t manage like the Grid, HPC user laptops.
* User developed analysis software has different requirements - often a mix between stages inside release, own code that might require specific directory structure.
  Physics reproducibility is important.
* Two approaches in ATLAS for images:
  * "Fat": Completely self-contained, local on disk, no network or local cvmfs install needed. But large (10GB+).
  * "Thin": Only provide OS, domain software from host install of CVMFS - needs network, and no immediate knowledge of what bits in CVMFS are used.
* Build both as part of nightlies for offline and analysis releases, distributed via Docker Hub.
* Work on CVMFS Graph Driver - “Fat” Image, can be used directly, but also deployed over CVMFS. Docker can then just pull the bits it needs.
* In use for local development, especially on non-supported platforms.
* In use for CI - easy integration on common platforms
* Also for grid deployment - using Singularity as container runtime. HPC may lack networked filesystems like CVMFS, but can support containers
* Using for Analysis Preservation - CERN Analysis Preservation Portal. Kubernetes cluster.
* Training: Easy entry point for new collaboration members.

### Discussion
* Size of "Fat" images depends on domain: User Analysis (small, ~2GB total) and Reconstruction (large ~20GB).
* How to track provenance of an image? In Images, have each layer was created, but not deterministic. Then the package manager layer, e.g. graph based deterministic.
* Some development to run docker images without root privileges, e.g. uDocker.

## AOB
* [Next meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/684972/) in 2 weeks, 13th December.
* Apologies to Guilherme on overrun - guide to using demo Portage Docker/CVMFS
  installs will be distributed, presentation at next meeting.
