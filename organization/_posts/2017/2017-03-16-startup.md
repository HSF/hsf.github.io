## Current Topics 

### CWP

-   Top level information page (with current known planned workshops) is: [*http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html*](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html)

-   WG reconstruction (D. Lange). Meeting yesterday with different people than San Diego. Almost done with the notes of the meeting, chapter outline in the new few weeks. Meet again end of April. Liz asking if there would be interested on common projects between the experiments. The LHC representatives there agreed there were common problems, but common solutions were not covered at the meeting.

-   Visualization WG (Ric Bianchi) reported on the progress preparing the agenda of the meeting.

-   Machine Learning. IML (Sergei) is moving forward.

-   Final workshop in Annecy. Organization is moving forward. It would be nice to have a report/presentation on the new CSBS Journal.

-   Training working group. Pete would like to see a chapter in the CWP that includes training and career aspects. Pete will contact Dario to start moving in this direction.

### HEP analysis ecosystem workshop

-   Venues: Pete visited the Eye verue, which is across the water from the Central train station. It looks very nice. It allows people to stay in hotels at the center and good connection to the station. By Monday should have everything ready and registration open.

-   Draft agenda is up [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/)

-   Moved the session notes out of indico to an easier to read and edit agenda outline [*googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2v4W5X216sXALToBTT-jT0fFkaIQhld2cqDnSqdv-I/edit?usp=sharing) . Pere will add the suggested conveners from the first organizational meeting. Liz will pick up the ball from there, and the first action is to ask for comment from the startup team.

-   Has been some discussions with Oli on fitting the CWP session into the analysis ecosystem agenda.

-   We should be providing guidance on the material for the presentation. Basically with what we are asking be covered and how should the information be organized.

## Activity updates

-   Packaging Working Group Meeting yesterday ([*https://indico.cern.ch/event/623070/*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/623070/)). Contributions from FNAL, CERN and LMU Munich (Belle II). Collect the github repositories to share what has been done by the different groups. The good news is that all of the proof of concept efforts report success so far.
