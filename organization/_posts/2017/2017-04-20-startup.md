## News, general matters

-   GSOC update. There ate very good news concerning the GSOC. Google has given to the HSF umbrella organization 26 project slots this year. This has to be compared with the 12 slots last year.

## Special topic: HEP analysis ecosystem workshop agenda

-   Draft agenda [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/)

-   Agenda outline [*googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2v4W5X216sXALToBTT-jT0fFkaIQhld2cqDnSqdv-I/edit?usp=sharing)

-   Proposal from Liz: parallelize the organization of the sessions and discuss globally.

-   Reminder of Axel’s proposal 2 weeks ago: send a the ideas in the strawman agenda to all the people that may bring some input and let them tell us what they could contribute to. Can be done in // with organization meetings.

-   Feedback is needed and this meeting is not sufficient. We need to call a meeting next week in an appropriate time slot. Decide asap (avoid Doodle): the sooner the better… Probably Tuesday 5 pm… to be confirmed (conflict with a Reconstruction WG meeting).

-   No opposition to parallelization proposed based on the session conveners: the meeting is about synchronization, not about finding ideas or proposals.

-   18 people registered so far... a bit slow registration.
