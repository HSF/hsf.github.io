## News and General updates

- Open Source Foundation. Pete introduced this. There will be meeting with them. Torre, Liz, Pete The money involved in hiring layers ... It would be simple. Getting the information has no cost and is probably worth.

## Training
- Riccardo joined the meeting.

- A start to WikiToLearn platform backing up the project by the physics department. Getting momentum (in Italy).
- Reluctance of people to put the material.
- Text Books: ROOT O'Really book, Springer book on HEP software development. Get contributors by crowd sourcing. We only need to find volunteers. We could pay them would be a possibility. Students are used to get notes and write them into courses notes collaboratively.

## Packaging
- Giulio post that the CMS system was migrated to Alice. Some changes were made to be open to other experiments.
- Liz: two worlds are now being settled: CMake and independent script-lets.
- Andrea any tools should be designed to be as general as possible.  We should get a presentation from Giulio. CMS will put some effort to collaborate with Alice on the tool.

## Licensing
- Comments to the draft document (from Liz).
- The restrictive license is always necessary in practice because we will always have one component that will be restrictive. When a component has the potential to be widely used then it need to be very permissive.
- Table combining license needs to be added into the document. The format is a bit screwed and perhaps we need to make it Latex.
