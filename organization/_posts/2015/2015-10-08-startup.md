# HEP Software Foundation Startup Team Meeting notes Oct 8 2015

[Indico Agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/453157/)

Present: Torre, Dario, Michel

Apologies: Andrea

Quick notes from a short small meeting:

## General updates

Logo contest:

- Torre will set up a page on the website, people can add there the candidate logos thus far, we can then include the logo contest in the newsletter

## Training

- Dario: WikiToLearn site gaining momentum, people are starting to put material in, not all is relevant to us but some is


## Licensing

- timescale to finalization: no later than the newsletter (1 week? two? not ten ;-), the newsletter will include mention of the finalized document

## Technical notes

- need to sort out the link-to-pdf business

## Software knowledge base and communication

- Torre: some progress on knowledge base, one essential feature still needed before it is ready: adding relations. Should be soon. It is now up persistently (or should be) at hepsoftware.org.


## AOB

- Michel - computing school recently held in France around topics such as continuous integration, code versioning... interesting material, at least for French speakers... will send a link
