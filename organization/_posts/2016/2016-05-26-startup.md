### Report of the LHCC Meeting(s)

-   Pete: Talked to Cristi Diaconu after the LHCC meeting yesterday. Cristi showed a few of Benedikt's slides about HSF during the closed session, and emphasized his support for the Community White Paper/roadmap process, with HSF as the umbrella organization, as a possible step towards the experiment TDRs (in 2019?). The experiments also seemed to be in agreement with the basic idea. The roadmap process, leading to a document by next summer, could be well aligned with the TDR plans. He also discussed with the LHCC chair (Forti) before the meeting and he seemed interested. A clear and positive statement about HSF and the roadmap process will likely appear in the LHCC minutes. 

-   Informal discussions. One possibility for the community to recognize the HSF and the CWP/roadmap process more officially would be to become ICFA "study group". This would provide a more official mandate for the roadmap work. ICFA meets twice per year and the next ICFA meeting is during ICHEP (in August). If we could get agreement on this with the relevant parties in the next months, and be recognized as an official ICFA study group in the August meeting, it would clearly fit nicely with beginning a roadmap process beginning in fall 2016. 

-   Benedikt agrees with the main messages. What will be useful is to have an official endorsement from experiments.

-   Andrea mentions the WLCG-OB presentation of Pete (June 3). This is also an opportunity to get the support from ‘managers’ and national representatives.

-   Summary: the process is just starting and seems positive so far.
