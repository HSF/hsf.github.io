## News, general matters, announcements

### EURO-LABS

European project just starting. Goal is to join nuclear phsyics, HEP and accelerator community for R&D. 
Low energy NP is quite different from HEP. Main focus is accelerator and detector R&D.
There is a computing WP, for open data management and building a federated data management system with an AAI. 
Complimentary with higher energy NP, like EIC and another opportunity to establish links with the (low energy) nuclear physics community on SW and computing topics.
It is a four year project. 70 people at the kick-off meeting in Bologna:

- See [Agenda](https://agenda.infn.it/event/32088/timetable/#20221004.detailed) for details

Good links to AIDAinnova and iFAST, e.g., organising transnational access. No strong link to EOSC yet, but ESCAPE colleagues are also involved (through GSI involvement).

### HSF India

HSF-India is a newly funded US/NSF project (US PIs are David Lange, Heidi Schellman, Verena Martinez Outschoorn, Rafael Coelho Lopes de Sa, Pete Elmer).  This project will fund training events, research exchanges, and fellowships with the aim of building collaborations spanning US, EU and Asia (starting with India). It is a 5 year project.

We will soon organize a topical discussion about the project with more information and to gather input. Most of the funding is to foster participation of junior researchers in research software projects across particle/nuclear/astroparticle physics experiments. A proto-webpage and 2 pager can be found [here](http://research-software-collaborations.org) - though last I tried, CERN was blocking this page.

I think none of us can make the meeting today - apologies - thank you again to the HSF for the letter of collaboration for our proposal (written circa October 2021!)

### Analysis Ecosystem II Workshop

Organising a [meeting next week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1211302/) (Tuesday 17h) to track how we address follow-ups from the workshop. Anyone interested is welcome!

We are converting the report from Google Doc to LaTeX, including the final list of 69 authors, and it will then be posted to arXiv.

## Working Group Updates

### General

We are approaching the end of the year, where we usually rotate the conveners:

- Which of the conveners wants to continue?
- Who would be good new candidates?
- Who volunteers to organize the convener search?

#### Meetings

Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Data Analysis

* Wish to turn the sessions on experiment on-boarding [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1175096/), and [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1175097/) into a document. The document will summarise contributions from each experiment and suggest "best practices" for future experiments
    * Will contact training WG and speakers
* Future meetings on Open Data - this is also very relevant for AGC and AF work

### Detector Simulation

- Next meeting on October 31st on FLUKA.CERN: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1196629/>
- Finalizing dates and speakers for differentiable simulation: most likely November 28


### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

Continue to put together the fall meeting lineup:

- Oct 19th: GNN tracking, Charline Rougier: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1210410/>
- Nov: RICH PID reconstruction. speakers confirmed, Finalizing dates, tentatively November 23rd
- Dec: KFParticle + HF tagging: Reaching out to speakers

### PyHEP

NTR this week - PyHEP report to come.
### Software Tools and Packaging
    
Will do a punch lunch (lunchtime meeting) with <https://www.punch4nfdi.de/> on packaging later in the year
- confirmed for Nov 3rd
- <https://indico.desy.de/category/897/>

Still lining up spack talks
### Event Generators

- Meeting last week with talk from Marcus on EIC/Nuclear physics
- Agreed to help organisation of MC4EIC (November) workshop
- Discussing next meeting topics
    - Review from Snowmass (will contact Josh Isaacson, Stefan Hoeche, et al.)
    - Follow up on generators with ML (e.g. hadronization).
    - Dedicated meeting on MC tuning - relevant across different areas (LHC, Nuclear, Neutrino), also a heavily software-focused activity, and something with potential for ML applications

### Frameworks

Nothing to report.  Still open to presentations from small experiments.

### Software Training

Conveners are at the IRIS-HEP retreat. More news to follow...

#### 5th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training

C++ Advanced training is happening now!

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Compute Accelerator Forum

Had a meeting yesterday on implementing GNNs on FPGAs for jet-finding (rather impressive optimisation work). Video is posted to YouTube.

November meeting should be with Meteo Swiss, on their GPU porting efforts.

### Software and Computing Roundtable

After the Future Trends workshop, we will start planning the next meetings soon.

### Analysis Facilities

Meeting today, on [IceCube's analysis facility](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1211255/)

## AOB

### IRIS-HEP/HSF Joint meeting on Software Citation and Recognition

We still plan this for 23 November, as a virtual event.

Organising meeting next Monday 17h, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1211156/>.

### HSF Calendar

We started filling in the calendar for 2023.

- [ ] ALICE
- [x] ATLAS

But please check and help!

### Email

We seem to have had some issues with email delivery again. The weekly announcement email was not received by some of us at CERN. Anyone else noticing issues? Please let us know.

### Next Meeting

Our next coordination meeting is on 27 October.
