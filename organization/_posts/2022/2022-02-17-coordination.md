## News, general matters, announcements

### Google Summer of Code

HSF call for proposals was sent a few weeks ago. Deadline for project proposals is Feb 21.

## Working Group Updates

### Detector Simulation

- Planned community meeting about GPU prototypes for simulation (AdePT, Celeritas) with leaders of those efforts: May 3-6, 2022 (15:00-19:00 CERN time)
    - In HSF Calendar, Indico placeholder <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1123314/>
- MARS talk scheduled for March (Monday March 28th)

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

Next planned topical meetings:
- March 9th, Patatrack and ACTS, jointly with Compute Accelerator Forum: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1077574/> 
- March 16th, 4D reconstruction (sPhenix & LHCb): <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1128087/>

### PyHEP

- Paper prepared as input to the second phase of the LHCC review of HL-LHC computing, which took place in November 2021, is now on the arXiv: <https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.02194>.
- Next topical meeting, Wed. March 2nd, is under preparation - waiting for confirmation from speaker.

### Software Tools and Packaging

- We had a joint meeting with the conveners of the Training WG. We discussed what kind of Spack training was feasible to develop and most appropriate for our community. Discussions between interested parties have begun.
- We have started discussion with the Frameworks WG to identify special topics on modern C++ about which we can coordinate inviting talks. This is inspired by the success of the PyHEP WG "module of the month" talks, but given the nature of C++ it may be more appropriate for this to be task-based rather than library-entity based. We have a meeting between WG conveners scheduled for next week.

### Event Generators

- Finished Snowmass contribution. Once Event Generators whitepaper draft is ready we'll circulate to the WG and encourage members to sign.
- We are going to get started organising topical meetings as detailed in the 2022 planning.
- Also hope to have an update on the ATLAS and CMS accounting soon!

### Frameworks

- We have scheduled our meetings for the first Wednesday of each month at 16:00 CET.
- Our first meeting will be on Mar. 2, where we will cover some basics of C++20 (could be advertised by other working groups).
- We will also meet with Software Tools and Packaging next week  to discuss common interests of modern C++ features and programming idioms.
- We'd like to have a small-experiment talk for our April meeting (speaker/experiment TBD).

### Software Training

- Regular weekly meetings at 16 pm CET Monday.
- Next IRIS-HEP & HSF training March 28-30, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1112526/>. Registration opening up early March.
- Continue work on `matplotlib` training development, zero to 4-lepton Higgs plot (beta status), <https://hsf-training.github.io/hsf-training-matplotlib/>.
- Joint meeting with Software Tools and Packaging meeting on training opportunities, resulting in plans for a `spack` user training (target: ready by summer) and potential future topics (tools to help debugging and improve bug reporting: e.g. interpreting gdb, perf, valgrind output).
- Color-blindness friendly updates to website.
