## News, general matters, announcements

### Analysis Ecosystems Workshop

The [AE2 Outcomes document](https://zenodo.org/record/7003963) is now on Zenodo - v1 is signed by the organisers.

It is now open for workshop participants to endorse (=sign), by adding their names to this [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xBcEkPnRQ90u9HDEGRX_Xs1APRb8ZhchmgrmO-JsShw/edit?usp=sharing) before 12 September.

### LHCC

The next LHCC Referees meeting is 13 September.

Please pass WG (1 slide) and other input to Liz and Graeme by **6 September** (the slides need to be given to the referees in advance). Or you can fill in the [Google Slide](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WtrwI4Ekgtv9RT-J85KbAa7dDb_bmF3mn6NpWVuIQbc/edit?usp=sharing) directly.

N.B. we are trying to broaden the report to cover other relevant events in the community, e.g., this time the CTD Conference and the IML Workshop. Other ideas are always very welcome.

### Twitter

After discussions with the training group we decided to start an HSF Twitter account, [@hepsoftfound](https://twitter.com/hepsoftfound) (it was a bit challenging to find a good handle!).

If you have a twitter account please follow and reweet a few things to help spread the word.

The intent is to use the account to

- Advertise HSF activities
- Retweet useful announcements of relevant events for HEP computing and software

ATM Graeme, Killian and Mark can tweet for HSF - please let us know if you would also like to help.

## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis

Coming back from summer break.

### Detector Simulation

Planning fall meetings!

- FLUKA.CERN: October 31st (speaker and date confirmed)
- Differentiable programming: November-December (contacted proponents)
- Opticks: tbd
- Varying Geant4 parameters: December? (tbd)

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

Continue with the topic list for the year and planning the fall meeting series. Topics include:

- GNN tracking 
- RICH-PID reco
- b-tagging

Further suggestions are always welcome.

### PyHEP

- Organisation of [PyHEP 2022](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1150631/) is more or less complete. Record number of abstracts received, split into tutorials, notebook talks and lightning talks and scheduled. Running time is 14-18h Mon-Fri CEST.

- We have also organised a 'hack-a-shop' to help participants bootstrap into becoming contributors and developers. It's the first time that we try something like this. Likely we will have two sessions, one for Europe + Asia, the other for America.

### Event Generators

Plans for the rest of the year

- Need to try to think about how to increase meeting attendance/engagement. 
  - It had dropped off in the last few meetings before the summer
  - Possibly partly related to email issues, also perhaps due to extending the meetings to more diverse topics, such as Neutrino and Nuclear physics?

- Meetings already scheduled
  - 1st Sept.: AI/ML-focussed discussion - Anja Butter [[2203.07460](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07460.pdf)]
  - 15th Sept.: EIC/NP Generators usage - Markus

- Future meeting topics
  - Follow up on various things highlighted in CSBS paper and HL-LHC review
    - Negative weights/reweighting/resampling
    - GPU port activities
  - Follow up on links between Neutrino and Nuclear activities and LHC

- Could also be useful to have a workshop?
  - Overlap with MCnet?

### Frameworks

[Planned meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1196608/) for Sep 21 with contribution about Jana2 framework (David Lawrence from JLab is the speaker).

- Overlaps with CMS Week, but the conflict with framework folks could be smaller than with any option considered for October

### Software Training

- Software Carpentry (Virtual) (28 Sep-1 Oct) <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1190572/>
  - Registration will open in a couple of days
- Next Hackathon: singularity/docker (Sept 6) <https://indico.cern.ch/e/hsf-training-hack-containers>
- Talks at "PyHEP", "Sustainable HEP" about Training
- Matplotlib hackathon happened on July 25 <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1183547/>
  - Matplotlib developer (Tom Caswell) is interested to make sure we are teaching "best practice"
  - Yes, Tom commented that during the training event. We opened a ticket based on one of his comments. 
- Look forward from other WGs to collaborate with training WG on their topic related trainings
- Join our hackathons to improve material taught

#### 5th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training

Registration will open next Monday 5 Sep, 9 am, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1172498/>.

The course itself will happen 11 - 13 Oct.

Doodle for signing up as a mentor - <https://doodle.com/meeting/organize/id/dwm961ma>.

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Compute Accelerator Forum

- 14. Sep, 16:30 CEST, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1073646/>, "SpiNNaker2 - Neuromorphic Computing"

---

## AOB

### Reminder: Future Trends in Nuclear Physics Computing Workshop

[Future Trends in Nuclear Physics Computing](https://indico.bnl.gov/event/15089/) will be 28-30 September at Stony Brook University.

### CHEP2023

In case you missed it...

[CHEP2023](https://www.jlab.org/conference/CHEP2023) will be May 2023. The [first conference bulletin](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/attachments/8232/11761/CHEP23_Bulletin_1-final1.pdf) is out (abstract submission deadling 17 November).

### ESCAPE / HSF connections

Meeting for Test Science Projects in ESCAPE/EOSC-Future hosted a talk from HSF Analysis Facilities (+ related activities: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1173792>. Discussions to resume this Fall.

### IRIS-HEP/HSF Joint meeting on Software Citation and Recognition

Planning a possible one-day meeting to discuss topics around how HEP experiments handle citation of software and recognition for software efforts that enable physics publications and other means of disseminating results to the public.

Candidate dates at the moment are 21/22/23 November. *Pick the date soon.*

Planning document will be circulated shortly. We will link to relevant discussions, e.g., at Snowmass this summer.

### Next Meeting

Our next coordination meeting is on 15 September.

We intend to restart the meeting at CERN in 32/S-C22 from next meeting, for those who are on the CERN campus.
