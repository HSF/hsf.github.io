# HSF Interim Foundation Board Meeting - Sep 17 2014

A third discussion of the HEP Software Foundation's Interim Foundation Board, chaired by John Harvey and minuted by Ian Bird. The discussion had two main topics, a leadership team to get the HSF started, and the next workshop. There were two actions:

 - Conclude on the nominations for the leadership team and the 2nd workshop at the next meeting. Feedback is needed from the community – either privately or via the mailing list.
 - Next meeting should perhaps also define the scope of the workshop, and avoid it being a repeat of the first.
