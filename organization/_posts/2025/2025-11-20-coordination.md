### LHCC Meeting News
- A few recommendations:
    - Associate with more software projects - mostly passive when projects come to us. HSF should be more proactive in approaching projects directly.

- The call for nominations for 2026 conveners is open. Please nominate those you know

### Physical Constants / HEPdata Library

Standing reminder: we proposed a C++ header-only library that defines physical constants and some salient HEPdata in a lightweight, easy-to-use manner. Also taking into account versioning.

Please get in touch with Graeme Stewart if you would like to discuss involvement in this.
