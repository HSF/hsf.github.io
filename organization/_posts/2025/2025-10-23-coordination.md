### Steering Group

- **2026 conveners**: It is that time of the year again to start initiating the process for identifying the 2026 activity area conveners.
  - Activity Conveners to notify Eduardo at earliest convenience whether they would like to continue or step down.
  - Volunteers to join search committee? Let Eduardo know by 28th Oct.
- We are still looking for another colleague to run the lightweight evaluation of the NoPayloadDB (a.k.a. HSF CDB) and client. Please get in touch with the SG/Eduardo if you can help out!

### Advisory Group

We have asked the advisory group to (re)advertise the HSF. The text is [here](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/6Wfvexa2QimHSIO-_Rmz3w) if you can do the same for a community not on the AG.

Sapta will make a poster that can be put on office doors and advertise to her undergraduates - get them while they're young!

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

- As said above (SG news), looking for an extra reviewer for the evaluation of the NoPayloadDB (a.k.a HSF CDB) and client.
- "Review" of DIRAC ongoing in the background.

## Activities Updates

### Software Training

##### Future Events:
- [13th HEP C++ Course and hands-on training - Advanced C++](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1549051/overview), 27-31 Oct.
- Blueprint Meeting on AI - TBD.
    - Survey to collect comments, and then organize a dedicated session with different collaborations to define a roadmap.

We are starting to organize training events for next year. We would like to focus on intermediate and advanced level trainings. If you have any suggestions, please let us know.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

Open datasets seminar "roundtable" looking at January time slot. We have talks confirmed for LHC open data, FM4NPP, and (successor to) TrackML.

### PyHEP

[PyHEP 2025 Users workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1566263/) next week! 243 registered, 30 presenting.
  - "Awkward Array Internals: A Hands-On Hacking Session" on Thursday, 30th. 
    -  [GitHub poll](https://github.com/scikit-hep/awkward/discussions/3683) - 59 votes - 33% want to learn about Awkward Array.

### JuliaHEP

First organising for JuliaHEP 2026 next week. It will probably be in Germany (99.999999%). As JuliaCON is in August we disfavour having JuliaHEP the week before/after - likely we'll wait until September or October.
