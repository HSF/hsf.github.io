## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (EPPSU) final stages

We are in the final stages of the process. We have endorsements from ALICE, ATLAS, Belle II, ePIC, LHCb and MCnet.

There were a few ~minor comments (adding references, mainly) as endorsements arrived. The continually updated final draft is in [CERNBox](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/XQ3wEp3L8UOVjjb).

CMS and DUNE are expected to endorse this week and WLCG will endorse when all LHC experiments are on board.

CMS asked how they could cite the document, so we have decided to put it onto Zenodo now, to have an immediate DOI. We will also put this final version on arXiv (but the arXiv publication delay means that that DOI will come too late).

### HSF/WLCG Workshop in May

- Abstracts have been coming our way - close to 20 now.
- Sessions are in preparation, in good shape but not yet published.
- Attendance seems low cf. previous workshops.
    - Please sign up!
    - A reminder will be sent to the HSF Forum.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).
[Compute & Accelerator Forum Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/)

The HSF Seminar on *technical debt in software* happened yesterday: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1520114/>.
- Around 30 people in attendance (~6 people in the room)
- YouTube recording already uploaded: <https://youtu.be/BkSiusiqhSk?si=mTqOtJZa2IOv5PS0>.
- No slides uploaded yet but speaker will do so soon - not many plots but plots shown very interesting, e.g.:
  
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/coordination/2025-03-26_SeminarSlideSnapshot.png" width="80%">

Planned seminars:

- Planning a seminar on HS3 (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) with multiple speakers. Finding suitable date in April/June - will exceptionally not be on last Wednesday of month (obviously avoid clash with CAF).
- 28th May: Seminar confirmed on AdePT and Celeritas update on detector simulation with GPUs via the Detector Simulation Activities conveners.

June has a clash with the EPPSU symposium - TBD if we have a seminar.

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@gmail.com>.

* Please send your suggestions for this Spring seminars...

### Steering Group

Next SG meeting is being planned for w/b 14 April.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

The review of the [nnpdf](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf) package in underway and the GDoc will soon be make available for feedback via the HSF Forum.
- Reviewers are Steven Mrenna and Eduardo Rodrigues.

ACTS are amenable to becoming affiliated - Graeme will join one of their dev meetings to explain the process.

Conditions DB - July will be a good time for the review.

## Activities Updates

Planning chats between activity conveners and SG liaisons are underway.
