## News, general matters, announcements

### 2026 conveners

The process to identify the 2026 activity area conveners (including the set of 2025 conveners willing to continue) is ongoing. The call for nominations has been sent out and the deadline is Dec. 12.
    - Please do not hesitate to (self-)nominate.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

Planned HSF seminars:
- Open Data seminar (Trig & Reco group): [28th Jan 2026](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1604475/).
    - joint with IML - any special organisation required?
- Seminar by Kati Lassila-Perini (chair) on ICFA Data Lifecycle panel [best practice recommendations](https://icfa-data-best-practices.app.cern.ch/) - 25th February(?)
    - Format still being defined.

Others in the works (no updates):
- Seminar on HS3 - still to land on a date.
- 2nd in series on AI-assisted SW tools organised by software tools & packaging.
- Seminar from creator of mp-units (supports units and constants in C++, see AOB) - still to be arranged.

(Thanks to the activity groups for coming to us with seminar ideas and speakers!)

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@googlegroups.com>.

Please send your suggestions for next seminars.

### Steering Group

Meeting held on December 2nd. Several matters discussed, see the minutes online on the HSF website (in the next few days).
Some quick points from what got discussed:
- Meeting held recently with the IML conveners.
    - Thank you the several of you AA conveners that connected. We were 10 connected with IML colleagues, which is pretty nice.
    - We touched on the scope of the HSF and IML.
    - There was consensus that we could and should engage more firmly in the future, and both parties will have that in mind and will be in touch when relevant, e.g. for future IML workshops that could have a training component, for joint seminars, etc.
- Extension of the AG members. News in due time.
- Status of Affiliation programme, see details below.

### Advisory Group

- Next meeting will take place in early 2026.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

- Role and status were discussed not that long ago at the November LHCC, where Stefan Roiser reported for HSF/community software.
- The list of affiliations is so far rather short.
- The good news is, we have several "reviews" ongoing:
  - DIRAC
  - NoPayloadDB Conditions Database
  - Pepper
  - MadGraph5_aMC@NLO
- Do not hesitate to discuss around you to identify relevant projects/libraries that could engage with the affiliation programme.

### Detector Simulation

We have had an HSF/IML [joint session](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1604483/)  on Monday, with talks on the simulation of calorimeter showers with ML. There were several contributions and plenty of discussion. 

### PyHEP

* PyHEP 2025 Users workshop: 
    * The recordings are ready to be uploaded to youtube with links to indico.
    * Proceedings - work in progress.
    * Workshop feedback collected and is very positive:
        * Hybrid format is preferred by 90%, others say online is OK. None suggested in person only.
        * Suggestion to announce it much earlier.
* As a followup: a collaboration with NVidia team on integration of Python CUDA Core Compute libraries in awkward array. The results will be presented in March at NVidia GTC 2026 in March.
* PyHEP.dev 2026 workshop in planning stage (by Peter F.). 

### JuliaHEP

JuliaHEP 2026 will be in Munich. End of September or beginning of October - TBD

JuliaCon 2026 - Mini-symposium proposal was submitted:
- JuliaHEP Mini 2026 - Julia for Nuclear and Elementary Particle Physics: From Precision Science to High-Performance Tools

We are organising JuliaHEP Users Meetings - every other month next year. TBA


## AOB

### Physical Constants / HEPdata Library

Standing reminder: we proposed a C++ header-only library that defines physical constants and some salient HEPdata in a lightweight, easy-to-use manner. Also taking into account versioning.

Please get in touch with Graeme Stewart if you would like to discuss involvement in this.

### Next Meeting

The next coordination meeting will be in 2026! On January 15th to be precise.

Till then, enjoy the end of year and the Christmas break!
