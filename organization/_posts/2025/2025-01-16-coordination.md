## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (ESPPU)

All of the Activity Areas have had their preparatory meetings with the community.

We are now gathering the drafts into [this Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dTUBTlerXHjrKO37hAuK1MednfukOxvkCSnq0HrnPOM/edit?usp=sharing) - we hope texts are in there by 17 January.

Anticipate then one week of editing from Michel and Graeme to harmonise the inputs, then one week for HSF "internal" review, before we release to the public the draft on 31 January.

#### Data Analysis

A draft exists and is a bit over two pages. We will do one more round of edits before copying into the main area.

#### Detector Simulation

The draft for the ESPPU has been linked to the Google Doc. It's a bit over 2 pages long, and it has already been reviewed by the representatives of the experiments and the Geant4 Collaboration.

#### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

A draft exists and is being edited and worked on. The Google Doc draft is currently linked in the main HSF draft Google Doc.

#### Event Generation

Draft in preparation.

#### Training and Careers

The draft will be moved to the main doc on January 17. It includes four sub-sections:

- Current Status
- Challenges
- Career Support and Recognition
- Recommendations

### HSF/WLCG Workshop 2025

Taking place on 5-9 May at IJClab, Orsay, Paris. An organisation team is being put in place.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).
[Compute & Accelerator Forum Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/)

Next scheduled events are:

- 29 January: trying to organise a meeting on future experiment studies
- 19 February: Verrou, floating point stability check
- 26 February: 4D reconstruction
- 26 March: EPPSU

### Steering Group News

The SG had a meeting this week. Minutes are still in [draft](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/TgTp9GuOGhROfIi).

- We are preparing for the first Advisory Group meeting next week.
- Claire Antel has joined the SG üôè
    - Reminder: the SG is open to all enthusiastic members of the HSF.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

*We need to find people to help do these reviews.* They are fairly lightweight and should not take a lot of time - we are checking usefulness and impact in the community, as well as software development and project best practices.

The [NNPDF collaboration](https://github.com/NNPDF) asked several months ago to be included - discussions with generator conveners to find an additional reviewer.

We should also start to approach our previous projects. Volunteers?

**Volunteer Corner:** People prepared to do 1 review in the next month: Graeme, Eduardo

Todo: add on the HSF site a page with the list of affiliated projects.

## Activity Updates

Many nominations received for new conveners for 2025. Thank you! Invitations have now gone out and we hope to conclude soon.

### Software Training

We are planning activities for 2025, including training events and hackathons. More details soon.

Some events confirmed:

- HSF Training Hackathon: Analysis Preservation - January 27,  17:00 CERN time

- [12th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training - The Essentials](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477096/) - March 10-14, at CERN. Registration is open. Mentors are welcome to help for the afternoon hands-on training sessions.

- HSF/IRIS-HEP Software Basics Training - June 18-20, at CERN

- Deep Learning Train-the-Trainer Workshop - ErUM-Data-Hub-HSF - September 15-19, in Potsdam
 
### Physics Generators

[NuSTEC](https://nustec.fnal.gov) is also preparing a ESPPU contribution that will discuss importance of neutrino event generators. Steven Gardiner is involved in both efforts.

### JuliaHEP

The next JuliaHEP workshop is planned to be at Princeton University, 28-31 July: <https://indico.cern.ch/e/juliahep2025>. More details to follow soon.
