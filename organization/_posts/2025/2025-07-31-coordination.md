## News, general matters, announcements

Given the low attendance, we decided to cancel this meeting.

CD and CA had a discussion on the Fall seminars and how to co-organise / share the slot with other groups (mainly WLCG environmental sustainability forum and EuCAIF FAIR and sustainable Working Group). 

Conclusion: HSF seminars will mainly take place on the last Wednesday of the month and the Compute & Accelerator Forum on the second Wednesday, so the other groups will avoid these slots. If there is a slot clash, the groups will discuss and in general the HSF seminars will have priority. 

After the August holiday season, Caterina will try to put all seminars in one single category to have a general view of what's going on in a single Indico page.
