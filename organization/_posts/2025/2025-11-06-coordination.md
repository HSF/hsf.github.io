### LHCC Meeting

The LHCC referees meeting will take place on the 18th November. Stefan Roiser will attend as liaison and will present on the following (requested by the LHCC):
- Update from Community Software/HSF on the status of the affiliated projects revision and the activities of the Advisory Group and Steering Committee.
- HSF's relationship with other AI-focused software coordination activities, such as EuCAIF, IML, or ML4EP.
- HSF vision on how AI-related software fits into HSF's strategy and organization.

Kindly get in touch with Stefan if you would like to provide any input.

### 2026 conveners

It’s that time of the year again to run the process to identify the 2026 activity area conveners.
- Last call, reminder: Activity Conveners to notify Eduardo asap whether they would like to continue or step down.
- The call for nominations for 2026 conveners will happen next week.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

Planned HSF seminars:

(Thanks to the activity groups for coming to us with seminar ideas and speakers!)

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@googlegroups.com>.

Compute & Accelerator forums:
- 12 Nov: [A Formal but Pragmatic Foundation for General-Purpose Operating Systems](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1472688/).

Please send your suggestions for next seminars.

### Steering Group

- Eduardo is organising a meeting with the IML group, on behalf of the SG, to discuss possible routes for closer collaboration and engagement related to AI/ML. All AA conveners are warmly invited to participate - any ideas are most welcome!

- The HSF via Eduardo got invited to talk about the HSF at the Spanish national meeting session on computing challenges (COMCHA network) in Valencia mid November.
  - Great opportunity to expose better the HSF, promote a closer collaboration via activities and tools, etc.

### Advisory Group

We have asked the advisory group to (re)advertise the HSF. The text is [here](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/6Wfvexa2QimHSIO-_Rmz3w) if you can do the same for a community not on the AG.

Sapta will make a poster that can be put on office doors and advertise to her undergraduates - get them while they're young!

(The AG members list has also been updated.)

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

- "Review" of DIRAC ongoing in the background.
- We identified 2 reviewers and the "review" of the nopayload DB and client will be starting soon.
- Pepper project colleagues interested and will talk to us for affiliation :).

## Activities Updates

### Software Training

##### Recent Events:
- [13th HEP C++ Course and hands-on training - Advanced C++](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1549051/overview), 27-31 Oct. Registrations:
    - 21 in person, 60 remote 
    
##### Future Events:

- Blueprint Meeting on AI - TBD
    - Survey to collect comments in the scope of training: What AI tools are being used right now?  What topics/tools would be useful for collaborators to be trained?
    - Then organize a dedicated session with different collaborations to define a roadmap on training.
- We are starting to organize training events for next year. We would like to focus on intermediate and advanced level trainings. If you have any suggestions, please let us know.

##### Other activities:

- Finalizing the paper "Training on Apptainer for HEP" for the The Journal of Open Source Education ([JOSE](https://jose.theoj.org/)).
    - Once ready, we will circulate a message with the draft to collect authorship information.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

Open Data seminar (Jan 28): speakers confirmed for talks on LHC open data, Collider ML, FM4NPP and COLLIDE-2V datasets.

### PyHEP

[PyHEP 2025 Users workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1566263/) took place last week!
   - Feedback is very positive: Ianna will summarize it in a couple of weeks.
     - First Awkward Array hackathon took place during the workshop.
   - Video recordings are being prepared and uploaded.
   - Proceedings - on a to do list.

A follow-up meeting with the NVIDIA Python CCCL group was held yesterday. We agreed to establish regular bi-weekly meetings going forward.

During the workshop, there was also a request from the Python community to assist with one of the non-HEP projects presented at the workshop. We need to discuss how and who will contribute to this effort.

### JuliaHEP

JuliaHEP 2026 will be in Munich. As JuliaCON is in August 10-15 (Mainz) we disfavour having JuliaHEP the week before/after - likely we'll wait until September or October.

JuliaCON 2026 - JuliaHEP Mini-symposium.

Organizing JuliaHEP Users Meetings - every other month.

### GSoC program 2025

A full report will come soon.

## AOB

### Physical Constants / HEPdata Library

Standing reminder: we proposed a C++ header-only library that defines physical constants and some salient HEPdata in a lightweight, easy-to-use manner. Also taking into account versioning.

Please get in touch with Graeme Stewart if you would like to discuss involvement in this.

### Next Meeting

The next coordination meeting will be November 20th, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477091/>, Joe will chair.
