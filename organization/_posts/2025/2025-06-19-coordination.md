## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (EPPSU) 

EPPSU is next week. There is a remote "listen in" possibility for the plenaries (Zoom link will appear on <https://agenda.infn.it/event/44943/overview>) and
for the software and computing parallel sessions on Monday (register at <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1560091/>).

N.B. Eduardo, Caterina and Nicole are all contributing to the parallel session. Draft to be circulated. 

Software and Computing plenary talks are 16h45-18h30 on Thursday.

### LHCC

We received very positive and enthusiastic feedback:
- The LHCC commends the Scikit-HEP project on its recent inclusion in the Scientific Python Ecosystem Coordination (SPEC) Core projects and encourages the HSF to continue strengthening their engagement with the broader Scientific Python community and integration of their training into HSF programs.
    - Worth a discussion within the Training conveners to see what could be tried as bi-directional engagement.
- The LHCC acknowledges the challenges in implementing the new HSF-affiliated projects, and recommends a prompt revision of this strategy.

Concerning a future WLCG-HSF 2026 workshop:

- The LHCC praises the success of the recent WLCG/HSF 2025 workshop and supports the launch of the Sustainability Forum.
    - HSF to discuss with WLCG about this forum for a collaboration on software aspects.
- WLCG is looking for a location. Email lcg.office AT cern.ch if you are interested in organising the event. Aim is to identify a location before the end of summer.
- WLCG agreed to NOT have a WLCG workshop before CHEP  (makes the event rather long and allows only for very topical discussions). There is hence the opportunity for the HSF to organise a focused event. To be discussed.


### IRIS-HEP Steering Board

Caterina Doglioni as the new HSF representative at IRIS-HEP is preparing [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zrV0P_kIDxwDS9bZsYYE6S3HXPUsaEXfKkQUYr8EjmA/edit?usp=sharing) from the HSF. The presentation is scheduled on July 15.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

Recent and planned seminars:

- 11 June, 16h30 CEST: Julia on GPUs for fun and profit. <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1472683/>
    - This event co-organised with the [EVERSE Network](https://everse.software/network/)
    - We will cross-advertise further events, but no future joint event planned at the moment.
- No topic for July yet

Venice workshop report tentatively scheduled for September. dCache project have signalled interest in presenting in a future Seminar. A seminar on HS3 will be organised also in the future.

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@googlegroups.com>

- Please send your suggestions for next seminars

### Steering Group

Graeme will step down at the end of the month. Election for a new (co-)chair(s) in progress.

Michel Hernandez Villanueva and Johannes Elmshauser have joined the SG - welcome!

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

We will work on a new version of the project affiliation - will be circulated for discussion when it's ready.

- Organized by the HSF and ErUM-Data-Hub

- Registration is still open! Deadline: August 4. 16 people registered!

Attendance is low - we have to understand why and decide where we would put put efforts in the future.

- Topics too basic?
- Not strong enough local organisation?
- Lack of fee (commitment)
- Discuss with experiments the needs they see
