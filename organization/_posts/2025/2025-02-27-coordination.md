## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (EPPSU) finalized for Advisory Group circulation

The document prepared by the HSF for the EPPSU has received a lot of
comments, none of them too controversial,
in the [original Google Doc version](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dTUBTlerXHjrKO37hAuK1MednfukOxvkCSnq0HrnPOM/edit?usp=sharing).
A finalized PDF version has been made after taking account of comments.
* A big thank you to all activity conveners who were very responsible to help finalize this document

The PDF sent to the Advisory Group to get their feedback and finalize
the endorsement procedure for each experiment, to get it on time for the
deadline (March 31). Weâ€™d like this document to be endorsed by
experiments rather than individuals, as we think it will have a bigger impact.

### EVERSE Network Launch Meeting took place

The EVERSE project is setting up a network of those interested in improving the quality of research software. They had their online [Launch Event](https://indico.cern.ch/e/eversenetworklaunch) on Tuesday 18 February.

Reportedly a great meeting. Regular meetings will follow. ~150 connected people!

### HSF/WLCG Workshop announced

Taking place on 5-9 May at IJClab, Orsay, Paris. The workshop was announced to the WLCG and HSF communities on Feb 20. Registration is now open, see the [indico site](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1484669/).

People are invited to register ASAP so that the local organizers can better prepare for the event. Please note that the early-bird registration deadline is Thursday April 3. Registration closes on April 22.

The timetable has been filled with the different sessions. While the agenda of each session is work in progress, the coarse timetable will not significantly change. This should allow people to start planning for their participation. The event will be an in-person event with (limited) possibility for remote participation. Given the nature of the event (an interactive workshop) we encourage in-person participation.

The HSF organisation team is Michel, Nicole, Eduardo, Paul.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).
[Compute & Accelerator Forum Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/)

HSF Seminar on 4D reconstruction took place yesterday Feb 26.
* Very interesting presentations
* Well attended: 65 connected, 10 in the room. Good sign for the new seminar organization.
* Meeting recorded, Graeme has it. 
* As a general point, could engage more non-LHC participation
    * Next seminar topic may be a good occasion

- 26 March: HSF Seminar - Technical debt on scientific SW (with a focus on some HEP frameworks)
    - European strategy seminar originally scheduled for this date is postponed

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at hsf-seminar-conveners@gmail.com
* Please send your suggestions for this Spring seminars


### Steering Group

Notes for the [11 February](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1509188/) steering group meeting are linked from indico.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

*We need to find people to help do these reviews.* They are fairly lightweight and should not take a lot of time - we are checking usefulness and impact in the community, as well as software development and project best practices.

As suggested last time a [google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GCy9Me2mroTdZLtWOdblHyrfkap9BOZp06XkXEd_XYM/edit?gid=0#gid=0) has been set up where people can indicate their willingness to participate as a reviewer in their areas of expertise. Please sign up! And thank you to those who already have. There is also a tab 'Projects' to gather planned and suggested projects for reviews.


**[Link to the review template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8Tkruo0EEHwgRBQPmiHq-i4BuwwiR1choRRMUIv6qY/edit?usp=sharing)**

The Steering Group agreed to approach Dirac, Rucio, ACTS, HLS4ML and XrootD to discuss engaging.

The Training Group will offer to help projects who want to improve their tutorials (this is required for a Silver badge).

## Activities Updates

Planning chats between activity conveners and SG liaisons are underway.

## Activity Updates

### Software Training

Future events:

- [12th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training - The Essentials](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477096/) - March 10-14, at CERN. Registration for in person registraiton will close 2 March. Mentors are welcome to help for the afternoon hands-on training sessions.
    - Looking for mentors for 10,12,14 March 14-16 CEST to help with the afternoon hands-on training sessions. This would allow us to go beyond the number of currently 22 local registered participants.
    - Also looking for a mentor for the Wed afternoon session to help (~90) remote students with the exercises on zoom (usually low effort)
    - Please contact Stefan 
- HSF/IRIS-HEP Analysis Reproducibility (Virtual) - March 24-28. Registration will be open soon.


### Software Tools and Packaging

Conveners met last week to plan for year ahead (without HSF steering group liaison for now).
- Intention to continue monthly seminar-style activities
    - next HSF seminar has topic that overlaps with software tools and packaging; coordination between conveners and organizers will happen
    - suggestion to organize as HSF seminar instead of (merely) activity seminar for wider distribution
- Addition of more show-and-tell activities on use of developer tools such as setting up IDEs, profiling, etc
- Provide live overview landing-page of various packaging solutions used in the community, with versions and quick start (conda, alibuild, cmssw, spack), similar to what was included in the 2018 whitepaper

### Detector Simulation
