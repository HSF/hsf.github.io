## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (EPPSU) final stages

Michel and Graeme unavailable, but here is the status:

The paper, *The Critical Importance of Software for HEP*, was finalised on time üëè.

- Submitted to the EPPSU process: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1439855/contributions/6461466/>
- Uploaded to Zenodo: <https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15097159>
- Published on arXiv: <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.01050> (if you are an editor, ask Michel or Graeme for the arXiv claim code)

The paper was endorsed by ALICE, ATLAS, Belle II, CMS, DUNE, ePIC, LHCb, MCnet and WLCG!

Q. Who is going to the open symposium in Venice? It would make a good topic for an HSF Seminar to report on this.

### HSF/WLCG Workshop

The agenda is available here: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1484669/timetable/>
### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

Planned seminars:

- Planning seminar on HS3 (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) with multiple speakers. Still trying to find suitable date with speakers in April/June - but getting a bit late for April.
- 28th May (as announced last time): Seminar on AdePT and Celeritas update on detector simulation with GPUs.

June has a clash with the EPPSU symposium - TBD if we have a seminar.

HSF seminar conveners are reachable at <mailto:hsf-seminar-conveners@gmail.com>

* Please send your suggestions for this Spring seminars

### Steering Group

Next SG meeting will take place on April 14th.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

The review of the [nnpdf](https://github.com/NNPDF/nnpdf) package in underway and the GDoc will soon be make available for feedback via the HSF Forum.
- Reviewers are Steven Mrenna and Eduardo Rodrigues.

### JENA Symposium

The Joint ECFA-NuPPEC-APPEC Seminar is ongoing in Harwell this week: <https://indico.global/event/5574>.

There is a long session on software and computing *today* - full report next meeting.

## Activities Updates

### General Standing Reminders

#### Website banners

We have the ability to put event banners on the HSF website. All it requires is a markdown file with the event data. See, e.g., files [here](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/tree/main/announcements/_posts/2023).

#### Meetings

Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

#### Videos

When meetings are recorded (recommended), please try to put them onto:

- [HSF YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/HEPSoftwareFoundation) (ask for permission to do this)
- <videos.cern.ch> (recommended over posting directly)

Then post links to these locations. See [C&AF](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/) for examples.

### Software Tools and Packaging

Ruslan Mashinistov:

- I reached out to people who participated in the GitLab DUO pilot at CERN, as mentioned in the AI-powered development tools at CERN slides, but unfortunately received no responses.
- Shuwei Ye, an AI tools enthusiast from the BNL NPPS (physics software) group, has agreed to share his experience. He has insights on Aider, DeepSeek-R1, Copilot, Codeium, and more.
- I need advice on how to attract more presenters and participants for the AI-assisted tools HSF seminar
