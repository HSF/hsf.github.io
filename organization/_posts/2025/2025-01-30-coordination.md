## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (ESPPU)

We now have an [advanced draft](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dTUBTlerXHjrKO37hAuK1MednfukOxvkCSnq0HrnPOM/edit?usp=sharing) - thanks to everyone who contributed to get the document to this stage.

Last week we got the inputs from the activity areas and Michel and Graeme did an editing pass, harmonising the style and drawing out key points as bulleted recommendations (for the TL;DR crew). A preamble and conclusion have been added.

The section on Event Generators still needs some more key input re. FCC-ee in particular; the other sections are close to final for this stage.

Timeline:

- HSF internal review this week (until Monday) - please read over and comment/improve
- Monday 3 Feb, Michel and Graeme will resolve all comments and prepare the first public draft
    - Having a robust section for generators by this stage is essential
- Tuesday 4 Feb, circulate public version, commenting period for ~2 weeks
    - In particular we will contact the experiment computing coordinators to pursue endorsment by the experiments
- Monday 24 Feb, prepare the final version of the document
    - Collect endorsements
- Before Monday 31 Mar, submit to EPPSU

Notes:

- We will stay in Google Docs for the public commenting period, then move to LaTeX in Overleaf for the final version
- To handle the pain of references, please add a literal `\cite{paper}` into the Google Doc text, together with the BibTeX citation at the bottom of the document
- The endorsement strategy will depend on feedback from the experiments
    - Individual endorsement doesn't make much sense if one's experiment is signing
- Activity area conveners will be added as editors
- The document is right on the limit for size (it's 12 pages in Google Docs, but much closer to 10 in LaTeX)
    - Therefore, if you want to suggested adding more, please also suggest what we can cut (zero sum suggestions!)
    - We will trim the document to fit into 10 pages (LaTeX) before circulation

### SHARIng Proposal

We have a request for a letter of support for the SHARing proposal from Davide Costanzo (Skills Hub for Accelerated Research Environments Inspiring the Next Generation proposal). This is an application for UKRI funds for Digital Research Infrastructure Skills Hubs for Accelerated Compute.

The proposal synopsis is attached to the agenda.

We have discussed in particular with Davide that we would anticipate working together on training, using HEP codes as test cases and helping on their advisory board from the HSF. Specifically:

- Participate in some of the workshops and some steering committees, overall once or twice a year. 
- The proposal is to fund "mini-projects" and we aim to have some of them to be in the particle physics area and with common interest with the HSF work. 
- We also aim to fund more training events, like the C++ school we had in Manchester last year, which was very well received. 

Comments to the Steering Group please!

### HSF/WLCG Workshop

Taking place on 5-9 May at IJClab, Orsay, Paris. The HSF organisation team is Michel, Nicole, Eduardo, Paul.
We at least need to have a "save the date" announcement and start herding abstracts et al. Can also put this on the website.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).
[Compute & Accelerator Forum Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/)

Next scheduled events are:
     
- 19 February: C&AF - Verrou, floating point stability check
- 26 February: HSF Seminar - 4D reconstruction
- 26 March: HSF Seminar - EPPSU

We have agreed to co-organise these meetings, so they can be coherent and reduce duplicated efforts. They will both live in the same Indico area to simplify attendees' scheduling. 

This could be in the new Indico Global instance - TBD.

### Steering Group

Next SG meeting is 11 February.

### Advisory Group

We had the first meeeting with the Advisory Group Friday 24 January - thanks to the experiments and communities who joined!

The outcomes of the meeting will be discussed with the SG and we'll report later.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

*We need to find people to help do these reviews.* They are fairly lightweight and should not take a lot of time - we are checking usefulness and impact in the community, as well as software development and project best practices.

The [NNPDF collaboration](https://github.com/NNPDF) asked several months ago to be included - discussions with generator conveners to find an additional reviewer.

We should also start to approach our previous projects. Volunteers?

**Volunteer Corner:** People prepared to do 1 review in the next month: Graeme, Eduardo, Uwe

**Link to the review template:** <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l8Tkruo0EEHwgRBQPmiHq-i4BuwwiR1choRRMUIv6qY/edit?usp=sharing>.

Todo: add on the HSF site a page with the list of affiliated projects. - now done, <https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/pull/1639>.


## Activity Convener Updates

We are essentially concluded for the convener search of 2025.

## AOB

### Website

There was a clean up of stale issues and PRs for the website.

Currently we are planning to stay with Jekyll + Minima, and just to make incremental improvements.

### Archive no-longer-maintained repositories in github.com/HSF  organization?

Can be safely archived, if no new maintainer found (in my opinion, (Valentin Volkl)):

https://github.com/HSF/TrickTrack
https://github.com/HSF/cmaketools
https://github.com/HSF/hep-spack
https://github.com/HSF/spack

ACTION: archive these repos.

### Next Meeting

Next meeting will be [13 February](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477071/)

### Chair This Meeting ð
