# HSF Weekly Meeting #87, March 30, 2017

#### *Present*: Frédérique Chollet, Benedikt Hegner, Michel Jouvin, Torre Wenaus, Graeme Stewart, Ricardo Bianchi, Peter Elmer, Andrea Valassi, John Harvey

## News, general matters

-   Please apply a reasonably high threshold to what you send to the forum list, it is supposed to be relatively low traffic.

-   Journal about Computing and Software for Big Science: now started, propose your articles!

## Current Topics 

### CWP

-   Top level information page (with current known planned workshops) is: [*http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html*](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/activities/cwp.html)

-   Additional information on the WGs is being maintained (and updated in fits and starts) on: [*http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html*](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/cwp/cwp-working-groups.html)

-   Visualization workshop taking place this week

    -   [*Riccardo’s workshop summary*](https://groups.google.com/forum/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer#!msg/hep-sf-forum/R6QefiZ3RUU/1xiO7kIiFAAJ)

-   Computing model: chapter outline anticipated soon from Ian

-   Analysis WG putting together an outline, will seed writing at the analysis ecosystem workshop

-   Logistics planning for Annecy workshop is underway, local organizing team is up and running

-   2nd meeting took place of the Simulation WG when the topic was Fast Simulation. Next meeting will be held on April 24th when the topic will be Geometry and Digitisation. We will start to create a googledoc to collect text for a Simulation WP that can be integrated in the final document. (notes added by JH).

-   P.Elmer and M.Neubauer met with FNAL Scientific Computing Division people (including muon/neutrino experiments) last week at FNAL, agenda is: [*https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=14032*](https://indico.fnal.gov/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=14032). Gave them a better understanding of what we’re doing, they are interested in some things. Clearly FNAL is an obvious choice to watch for synergies between LHC and non-LHC/Intensity Frontier (IF) experiments. We need a lean on the FNAL/LHC participants in the CWP to interact with the non-LHC/IF people at FNAL as we proceed through the next months for the CWP.

### HEP analysis ecosystem workshop

-   Draft agenda [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/timetable/)

-   Agenda outline [*googledoc*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F2v4W5X216sXALToBTT-jT0fFkaIQhld2cqDnSqdv-I/edit?usp=sharing).

-   The Eye Film Institute in Amsterdam is confirmed as the venue, the registration was announced on Tuesday (see, [*http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/page/10082-event-registration*](http://indico.cern.ch/event/613842/page/10082-event-registration)) . Additional travel details will be added over time to the Indico pages.

-   Invitations for session conveners have gone out, we should start to decide talks and speakers and engage the conveners in helping with this. Will invite conveners to next week’s meeting to start this discussion.

-   (Peter) - I had a discussion with Max Baak (formerly Nikhef, Atlas and BaBar) who now works for the KPMG “Big Data” group (with Sander Klous, also formerly Nikhef, Atlas, plus other ex-HEP people). It would be interesting to get a presentation from him on their perspective on HEP software (and how it could evolve) based on their experience in industry.

## Activity updates

-   

## AOB

Graeme was invited to give a talk on “Parallel Processing and HEP” at EPS (part of the ECFA workshop). He’d like to make that an HSF badged talk.

Andrea will present HSF and CWP in CERN IT, will circulate slides, would appreciate feedback

We will meet next week.
