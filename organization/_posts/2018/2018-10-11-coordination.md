News, general matters
=====================
-   Maria Girone contacted us for an HSF speaker for the CMS ECOM2X
    (committee looking at software and computing evolution for Run3
    and Run4). Eduardo agreed to do that.

HSF/WLCG/OSG workshop
=====================
-   OSG have now confirmed their participation in the 3-way workshop at
    JLab 18-22 March next year.
-   Next step is to try and identify topics we want to make sure are
    covered, and prepare a draft agenda.
    -   Meeting next week for WLCG/HSF people.
    -   Please send any early thoughts to Graeme/Michel/David
        (organising for HSF).

New Working Groups
==================
-   [*Draft mandate
    document*](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvgBqCk1kWgY90iAkjl84eLbO3b1qllEDRvG8FVfemI/edit?usp=sharing).
-   Some comments made by Caterina and Frank (thanks!). Now all
    converted into concrete suggestions.
    - Each proposed change was discussed and refined, then we agreed on it.
    - Concrete deliverables were raised, how much can we push these?
        - Can’t put too many constraints on
          conveners for things that it is not in their power to deliver.
          Main deliverable is a functioning community.
        -   Dario - make this bottom up.
    -   **Meeting agreed on the mandate now.**
-   Would like to now call for further nominations.
    -   One or two weeks?
        -   Two weeks. Graeme will send the call.

Generators Software Computing Workshop
======================================
-   [Indico agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/751693/).
    -   Organisation progressing well, quite a number of speakers
        confirmed, 25 people registered.
    -   Next [meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/763170/) for the
        organisers immediately after this one...

Activity updates
================

Packaging
---------
-   Next meeting tentatively next week (get in touch with Graeme or Ben
    for any topics to present).

Software Forum
---------------
-   Successful [*meeting
    yesterday*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/745286/) with a
    presentation on optimisation work done in CERN IT.
    -   Some discussion over estimated gains from using vectorised
        instructions.
    -   Minutes in preparation.
-   Open slot in two weeks time, 24 October.
    -   Any volunteers?
-   Then further topics will go into 2019.

PyHEP
-----
-   We want to converge and identify a representative from the Intensity
    Frontier to
    join the efforts. If you know of a great candidate (yourself or
    ...), please shout ASAP.


CWP
===
-   ### Publication status for Individual WG Papers
    -   **Event/Data Processing Frameworks**
        -   Abstract added and few mistakes fixed in [this
            PR](https://github.com/HSF/documents/pull/103);
            references and final author list still need done (should
            not take too long).

AOB
===
-   HSF Logo in vector format - reminder of action on Benedikt.
-   There was a discussion with Claire Boudarios (ATLAS) about outreach
    activities and the HSF’s involvement there.
    -   Graeme - no activity in this area as far as I am aware.
    -   Is anyone interested in this topic?
        -   Dario and Pete are - Graeme will pass on contact details.
-   http://hepsoftware.org/ has been down
    for a week - tracked as a [GitHub
    issue](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/390).

Training Discussion
===================

[Slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/764014/)

-   Our goal is to start a concrete activity.
-   IRIS-HEP has a small training component.
-   FIRST-HEP is totally dedicated to training.
    -   Try and strengthen training in the whole community.
-   Tier 1 - build out of StarterKit, and Software Carpentries.
-   Tier 2 - this is HEP specific, but could organise more “boot camps”
    and BOFs.
-   Tier 3 - already an established network of schools.

-   Dario - we didn’t yet have time to work on more specific plans
    -   What about University engagement? Traditionally this is quite
        weak in Europe.
        -   Our model adapts to an inhomogeneous intake already, and
            seems a much more tractable problem to start with graduate
            students.
        -   Liz - most physics computing teaching done by physicists
            already.
    -   If funding is US based, how can we make sure that there are
        similar initiatives for Europe?
        -   CERN based training will help (but students still need to
            get here and be funded...).
        -   Also doing regional events at which students will be
            present.
-   Liz - if something at FNAL should we include neutrino people?
    -   Yes.
- Pulling off something practical (Tier 1 training and
  survey, detailed on the final slide) is more important.
  - **Meeting agreed to that.**
-   CMS: FNAL is natural.
-   ATLAS: CERN? Could be a good place to bootstrap? Graeme,
    Davide to follow up.
    -   Key point to build up this cohort of trainers, who then have
        their own regional connections.
-   Sudhir - want to tie this to a concrete CMS event, maybe beginning
    of next year.
-   Training survey - there was a draft floating around, need to
    re-circulate it.
    -   Graeme thinks ATLAS did do something in this area (perhaps
        tangentially), he will follow up.
-   *Promote training as part of people’s mental landscape*
