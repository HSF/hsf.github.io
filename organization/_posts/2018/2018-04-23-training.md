- Attendees introduced themselves as it is big spectrum of people
- A bit about attendees role in their respective experiments/labs/
    - Albert Puig Navarro and Dario Berzano (Coordinate StarterKit at LHCb and ALICE)
    - Dario Menasce (CMS HSF Starter group/ Sci Comp Committee)
    - David Lange (CMS Software infrastructure)
    - Francesco Giacomini – (Bertinoro School of Computing/ Yearly held in October)
    - Ilya – (Coordinate Documentation and training/software/outreach in Belle2)
    - Louise Heelan – (Train/documentation coordinator/ 5-day
            analysis/workshop/analysis workbook in ATLAS)
    - Markus Schulz – (CERN IT Performance Team, improving computing efficiency to
            meet HL-LHC demand)
    - Rob Kutschke – FNAL/Mu2e head of Comp. & Soft./develop training material for ART
            framework used by neutrino experiments at Fermilab)
    - Servesh Muralidharan – Interested in Training and improving performance of HEP
            code)

- Meeting highlights – building a federation of training activities across experiments
  specific training and non-experiment computing schools

    - Start with putting together a google doc with info on dates of experiment
      specific/non-specific training activities. Click here(do right click)
      https://goo.gl/Kwbk73 for google doc.
    - Later have a website to show training schedules and public material -
      presentations/good software related examples/exercises and best
      practices/reference material
    - Training material at three tiers
        - Lower - examples - Linux/C++/Python
        - Medium – ROOT/Geant4
        - High – Machine Learning/ GPUs/ Developer level
    - Try to share teachers/lecturers among schools at least on common topics and
      build a community sense
