News, general matters
=====================
-   Graeme gave a talk on the HSF status at ATLAS S&C Week in Hamburg.
    -   Slides
        [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Hoct64tHMC6ehxnrafpOseyKOCAout5FthvTh2sgu2Y/edit?usp=sharing)
        for reference ([pdf version
        attached](https://indico.cern.ch/event/740548/attachments/1676548/2692723/HSF_RD_and_Activities.pdf)
        to this week's agenda).
    -   Generators workshop raised a fair amount of interest.
-   Eduardo created an HSF community on Zenodo, see
    [https://zenodo.org/communities/hsf/](https://zenodo.org/communities/hsf/).
    It provides a nice way to tag our future DOI'ed publications and
    search for them.
-   Michel will circulate the draft of his CHEP presentation about CWP
    and R&D out of it next week.
-   Andrea: got WSSSPE (sustainable software) announcement through the
    RSE list, workshop colocated with eScience in Amsterdam fall 2019.
    Pete attended it years ago. Could be interesting to submit a
    general talk on HSF and the CWP community process.
    -   Submission of papers by July 11th.
    -   To discuss via coordination list, but submission is quite
        significant: 2 page paper for 5 minute talk; 10 page paper for
        20 minute talk.

Activity updates
================

Licensing
---------
-   No time to organize the follow-up discussion with Fastjet authors
    before the summer, will do it after!
    
Training
--------
-   A LAL fellow about to start working (4 months) on training material
    inventory. Starting with the French context but has been discussed
    with the Training WG (Dario et al).
    
Packaging
---------
-   Meeting [next
    week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/737348/) to review
    CHEP talk from Ben.
    
Frameworks
----------
-   Pre-CHEP
    [workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/727646/)
    organised. Some interesting discussions about heterogeneous
    computing at ATLAS S&C Week.

Software Development
--------------------
-   Some nice discussion on the mailing list about profiling tools.
    Giulio is starting to work on a WG page with this information for
    the website.

Software Forum
--------------
-   Next meeting 18 July (after CHEP).
-   Graeme has discussed with some people from DIANA-HEP and HEP.TrkX
    and they will be happy to contribute to future meetings.

Technical Notes
---------------
-   Technical note on [HSF Platform Naming
    Conventions](https://github.com/HSF/documents/tree/master/HSF-TN/2018-01)
    is finalised.
-   Technical note on [HSF Project Best
    Practices](https://github.com/HSF/documents/tree/master/HSF-TN/draft-2016-PROJ)
    is now circulated more widely, please give feedback (before
    31/7/2018).
-   Graeme will send an email with this as an update.

PyHEP Workshop
==============
-   Pre-workshop questionnaire closed since yesterday. Excellent
    feedback from 50 out of 71 participants! Input most useful for
    discussions and open discussion on training.

Generators Software Re-engineering Workshop
===========================================
-   A few discussions with interested parties. Andrea investigating the
    possibility of having the workshop in Firenze (Galileo Galilei
    Institute for Theoretical Physics).
-   To fix a date for the workshop, it would be useful to know the date
    of the LHCC review early 2019. Would a workshop Jan-Feb 2019 be ok
    if the review is later?
-   Andrea: heard from CMS colleagues that Andy Buckley gave a talk
    yesterday in the CMS generator group on \"Performance bottlenecks
    in MC community code\", which probably mentioned the workshop
    plans. Will try to get some feedback on how it was received.
-   No progress last week on the one-page summary. Will meet
    Michelangelo next week.

CWP
===
-   ### General Matters and Roadmap
    -   CSBS news: proper submission now done, using the editorial board
        HSF email address. Has been received by the editor-in-chief! A
        referee will be assigned soon.
-   ### Publication status for Individual WG Papers
    -   **Data Organisation, Management and Access**
        -   Submission work about to restart\...
    -   **Careers, Staffing and Training**
        -   Last updates to CWP paper are almost there, should then be
            ok to submit to arXiv. From my point of view (Dario) the
            paper could be considered frozen: beginning the
            procedure of submission to arXiv (Graeme pointed me out
            the link to the how-to).

AOB
===
-   First iteration of website reorganisation done by Graeme got merged
    into production website.
    -   Got rid of the newsletter centre column (alas, this never really
        took off).
        -   Now replaced with a bit of "topical" text - should be easier
            to keep up-to-date.
    -   Activities link was updated to our active areas.
    -   CWP activity was moved into the Organization/About section (and
        linked in the right places as well as redirected from the old location).
    -   There is now a [Future
        Meetings](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/future-events.html)
        link, which is based off the HSF Google Calendar Agenda.
        -   It was much easier to make this work than to use Indico
            (remember the website is built *statically*).
        -   But it does mean people need to remember to [add events to
            the Google
            Calendar](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/calendar.html)
            (could that be automated from HSF Indico?).
        -   N.B. This now mixes HSF events themselves with the other HEP
            events.
            -   Is this ok? Would people want a separate HSF event
                calendar? Advantage would be clearer information
                separation. Disadvantage would be another calendar to
                subscribe to and manage.
    -   About section reorganised:
        -   Coordination team trimmed to active people (in last year).
        -   Dropped "timeline".
        -   Presentations now easier to find.
        -   Links to CWP.
    -   Started a [stub for inventory of
        projects](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/inventory/inventory.html):
        -   Links to KB for now, but this is an "unordered" collection.
        -   Really, a TODO for *everyone* to help find the key projects.
            -   But we need to stay inclusive.
    -   Further ideas still to be collected
        [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8x8Ua9E__vp_9i3KwLGrgk8QDAIGL4-ZPsqvPOUCQY/edit?usp=sharing)
        (or you can raise a [GitHub
        Issue](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues)
        or make a PR directly).
-   Benedikt has a copy (the only copy!) of the HSF logo in vector
    format.
    -   We will put this into the HSF documents repository and make sure
        it's linked from the website.
-   Next week - not sure if we will have a meeting as people will be
    busy preparing for CHEP. Will ask on Coordination list next week.
