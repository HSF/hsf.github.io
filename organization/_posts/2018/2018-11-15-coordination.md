      - Pere’s proposal : write a couple of pages around importance of
        taking software & computing into consideration early in the
        process of designing new machines/detectors and refer to the

  - Michel encouraged Antoine Pérus, one of the GSoC coordinator, to
    plan a presentation of next year timeline for GSoC around
    mid-december to raise the attention of the community early (as

  - HSF Logo in vector format - reminder of action on Benedikt.
