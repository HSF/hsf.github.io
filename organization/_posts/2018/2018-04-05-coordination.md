=====================
-   Call for papers to [UK Research Software Engineers 2018](http://rse.ac.uk/conf2018/) was circulated to lists.
    -   A few people are interested in working on an HSF paper, Graeme
        will follow up.
-   2018 CERN School of Computing (CSC 2018) applications open,
    [https://indico.cern.ch/e/CSC-2018](https://indico.cern.ch/e/CSC-2018).
-   CERN OpenLab organising a 2 day workshop on Quantum Computing, w/b 5
    November.

HSF/WLCG Workshop Follow-up
===========================
-   Gather important items that we should be tracking after the workshop
    (see workshop [live
    notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QSkvwRK_2HENuxYXcs9Op1dTUK824KddQ1Tfan-P0WU/edit?usp=sharing))
    -   ### General Points
        -   We need a newsletter!
            -   Graeme to follow up.
        -   Benedikt will give a WS summary in next week's EP-SFT meeting.
    -   ### Common Data Management and Data Lakes
        -   WLCG lead here.
        -   Are there software implications?
            -   Needs a global view and to see how the data will be used
                by applications - production and analysis are quite
                different. Software stacks and ROOT are important.
        -   Identified issues with content delivery, tape carousels,
            etc. Horizontal and vertical dimensions.
        -   Will start a mailing list for this R&D.
            -   Need to relate to other WGs in this area, e.g., WLCG
                Data Management Steering Group.
            -   Will have to organise regular meetings.
            -   Need to add a few more notes.
    -   ### Frameworks and Infrastructure
        -   BOF session pre-CHEP - activity before that?
        -   1 / month meeting to help here. Liz will help look for a
            convenor.
    -   ### Programming for Concurrency and Co-Processors
        -   Tracking community seems quite well organised (CTD, Kaggle
            challenges, etc.).
        -   Michel spoke to David Rousseau, coordination between ACTS
            and HEP.TrkX is taking place.
    -   ### Simulation
        -   Ongoing activity around the GeantV prototype.
        -   Geant4 have proposed R&D activities.
        -   Some concerns from Daniel about 2 weaker R&D area
            -   ML effort seems weak, can this be strengthened?
            -   Use of HPCs remains a concern for us: this is a wider
                problem for HEP workflows.
    -   ### Analysis Facilities and Use Cases
        -   Expanded summary + follow-up asked to be presented at next
            WLCG GDB meeting on April 11th. Eduardo to do it.
        -   We need to keep activities alive, "connected" and,
            hopefully, focused, with an effective communication across
            experiments in particular. Some suggestions will probably
            be written down in the GDB presentation.
            -   Example activity: ALICE tests of Apache Arrow + TDataFrame.
    -   ### Software Development
        -   Documentation of how to use profiles / static analysers
        -   Web based GUI to browse and compare different profilers.
        -   Common plugin based mechanism for clang-tidy so that adding
            checks does not require modifying the upstream sources.
    -   ### Visualization
        -   Ric to follow-up.
    -   ### Workload Management
        -   R&D prospects primarily in WM aspects of WLCG-led DOMA/data
            lakes R&D and how to use WM to manage/optimize
            DOMA-related operations.
        -   Link to frameworks and what the brokered units of work are,
            across the scale spectrum from datasets to events.
        -   DOMA = data organization, management and access
    -   ### Security
        -   WLCG led, some ongoing discussions identified.
        -   Trust groups with grid/campus teams.
    -   ### Performance and Cost Modeling
        -   WLCG led, group is pretty active already.
    -   ### Data Preservation for HEP
        -   Organised community.
        -   Links to analysis.
    -   ### Training and Careers
        -   See below...
    -   ### Others:
        -   Technology watch group should be launched. Relationship to
            other groups (Cost Model, Benchmarking) should be defined,
            but not merging them at the moment.
        -   Andrea - worried about the generators in general. Deserves
            some follow-up, Graeme involved (but unfortunately off
            next week at the time of the next MCnet meeting,
            [https://indico.cern.ch/event/689514/](https://indico.cern.ch/event/689514/)).
            Liz can engage with MCnet people next week. Idea
            starting to be discussed to organise a workshop dedicated
            to computing requirements for generators at HL-LHC.
            Configuration of generators has a big impact on resource
            consumption. Need to do some baseline benchmarking between
            the different experiments and get an understanding of
            costs in each generator and costs of each process.
        -   Links to OpenLab are important - they produced their own
            White Paper end of last year, for the next 3 years of
            activities.
-   ## Practical follow ups at the HSF level
    -   Inventory of community activities.
        -   Should go with general website reorganisation.
    -   More variation in themes in these meetings (more topical)
        -   Would really need a better room to show slides on Vidyo.
        -   Time ok? It's rather early for Pacific Time.
        -   Need also to have organising meetings, but alternating would work.
    -   Collaboration guide for projects
        -   New white paper suggested by Pete (but short!)

CWP
===
-   ### General Matters and Roadmap
    -   Second draft of one of the Symmetry Magazine articles from Sarah
        Charley.
    -   CWP article was published in the CERN Courier April edition
        (cover this in the newsletter too).
    -   Graeme will give a CWP talk at the [GridPP40
        meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/684659/)
        next week.
    -   Publication in CSBS - need to follow up with the editors.
        -   Graeme and Michel to follow up.
-   ### Publication strategy for Individual WG Papers
    -   ### Machine Learning
        -   Sergei says it's basically done, "waiting for an updated
            version of a plot and we are good to go to the arxiv".
    -   ### Software Trigger and Event Reconstruction
        -   PR for the documents repo please!
    -   ### Data Organisation, Management and Access
        -   Last call for comments about the LaTeX paper in Overleaf:
            expires end of next week. Will be ready for arXiv
            afterwards.
    -   ### Data Analysis and Interpretation
        -   Still problems uploading to arXiv?
    -   ### Conditions Access
        -   Paul has not followed up yet.
    -   ### Generators
        -   Discussed at Naples. Feeling was that the CWP chapter was
            good enough and that there should be more of a work plan
            oriented follow up with the theory community, an autumn
            workshop? N.B. There is an [MCnet
            workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/689514/)
            next week at CERN.

PyHEP Workshop
==============
-   "Advert paragraph" for upcoming 3rd CHEP bulletin in preparation.
-   Agenda itself will be given a push in the next week or so.
-   We have 23 participants registered so far - a healthy number.

Activity updates
================

Licensing
---------
-   Organise meeting with Belle II who are interested in clarifying
    their situation.
-   Follow-up time with FastJet.
-   Indico will move from GPLv3 to MIT license in next version (2.1) to
    make easier adoption outside the academic world. See
    [https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/3255](https://github.com/indico/indico/issues/3255).
    All commit authors contacted.
-   ATLAS: looking at making the code public but stuck in trying to
    "sanitize" the history... Advice/recommendations from HSF and the
    community may help...

Training
--------
-   Create a \"federation\" of existing schools, a \"logical\" place
    (instead of a \"physical\" one) where to plan together school
    calendars, training materials, eventually exchange tutors and
    slides and so on.
    -   Another Google Calendar?
-   Make sure is that all of us representing our different experiments
    have a mandate from our own very experiment to represent it. This
    is important to ensure continuity in representation of an
    experiment/community and make it an individual independent.
-   Let us try to meet virtually post Napoli meeting to discuss the
    future path of Training and Career
-   A good place would be to have a website displaying schedule of
    Training activities of our experiments of the kind that all of us
    showed in our talks so that we are all aware of what is happening.
-   Also we should have an egroup kind of email to communicate with this
    community.
    -   There is a training group email on Google -
        [https://groups.google.com/forum/\#!forum/hsf-training-wg](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-training-wg)
        ([hsf-training-wg\@googlegroups.com](mailto:hsf-training-wg@googlegroups.com))
-   At the same time we can think of creating common training material
    up to the point where it becomes experiment specific. There was a
    lot of common training topics listed in all the talks and those
    would be a good place to start.
-   A future step should be, if possible to invite, training experts
    from one experiment to the other to get a first hand feeling
    commonality. Such an opportunity can be communicated via the above
    email group.

Packaging
---------
-   Discussion slot last week in Naples - good to communicate with a
    wider group of developers.
    -   Containers are important and simplify things.
    -   Test driving solutions is the next practical step.
-   Meeting
    [yesterday](https://indico.cern.ch/event/716297/)
    ([minutes]({{ site.baseurl }}/organization/2018/04/04/packaging.html)
    available)
    -   Reviewed Naples.
    -   Feedback from first (naive) test drive of Nix
-   Next meeting [18
    April](https://indico.cern.ch/event/719557/).

GSoC
----
-   Student applications now closed. Have asked mentors to provide
    feedback on the proposals - ranking for the students needs to be
    communicated to the admins. Today is the hard deadline!
-   Tomorrow admins will meet and decide on the min/max slots to give to
    Google. Min = number of projects with very good students; Max =
    add projects with good, but not outstanding, students. No
    decisions on projects yet.
