CWP
===
-   ### Publication strategy for Individual WG Papers
    -   Data Organisation, Management and Access
        -   Hopefully good news next week
    -   Data Analysis and Interpretation
        -   Still problems uploading to arXiv?

PyHEP Workshop
==============
-   Keynote presentation on JupyterLab confirmed, given by one of the
    developers, namely Vidar Tonaas Fauske (Simula Research
    Laboratory, Norway).
-   Number of recent registrations not commensurate with those for CHEP
    but may simply reflect the domain of work of registrants.

Activity updates
================

Licensing
---------
-   Belle II interested by a meeting with HSF on this topic.
-   License for DD4HEP: it is currently GPL, potentially a problem.
    Discussing moving to LGPL. This is a more general problem with
    AIDA2020.
    -   Also need to check the copyright owner. Would be good to have
        CERN but need to be checked with all the participants
    -   Most SW projects predate AIDA2020 and had a license chosen
        before the HSF discussions

Training
--------
-   No news

Packaging
---------
-   No news

GSoC
----
-   29 slots obtained from Google for 109 proposals from students
    concerning 51 HSF projects
