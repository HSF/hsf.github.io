Introduction - Graeme & Ben
===========================
- CHEP paper accepted as a presentation: showcase work and attract more interest. Nice target to work towards testing.
- HSF Workshop next week - this WG will contribute to the Software Development stream
- [Use Cases Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h-r3XPIXXxmr5tThIh6gu6VcXXRhBXtUuOv14ju3oTI/)
  - Some clarification on install time relocation
  - Version 1.0, but further additions to make 1.1 etc anticipated
- Sprint Workshop for SPI project (CERN/SFT team that produces LCG Stack, and work with GENSER team for generators)
  - Goal is consensus and common perspective for SPI over next 2-3 years
  - Synergy with this group, so input welcome, Graeme/Ben will contribute/attend
- HSF rebranding: “hep-sf” -> “hsf”
  - For this WG, Github organization is now at [https://github.com/HSF](https://github.com/HSF)
  - There are redirects, but check your remotes
  - Mailing list is now: hsf-packaging-wg@googlegroups.com
- Today: Intro/test stack(Ben), Nix package manager (Chris), as always proposals for future contributions welcome, contact Graeme and Ben.


Test Stack - Ben
================
- [Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LW8OsTFFA9QwsJ9fASkRoJ2E6Gk3UGnOQIcElCL8UCM/edit) updated: Idea is to have a standard way that people can contribute builds of the test stack with the different package managers that can be easily tested by the wider group.
- Linux containers are a good idea to have a controlled environment and to make sure dependencies on the system are well expressed.
- Will make things more sophisticated later, but have a good test setup to begin with.
- There is a template that shows how to describe the installation and build environment for people.
- Use of the GitHib packaging repo can be a central place to work and share information:
  [https://github.com/HSF/packaging](https://github.com/HSF/packaging)
- Can one use the Gentoo image? Maybe not the best as it’s little used in HEP.
- Suggestion to target CentOS7 as the “standard candle”.
  - Next Ubuntu LTS will be out soon (18.04).
- This is only a bootstrap step - then we need to look at the use cases and see how well they are satisfied.
- Martin: Centos7 seems the easiest, SLC6 is hard because it’s very old, Ubuntu (latest) is hard because it’s very new.
  - Again, CentOS7 is a good place to start, but then diversify.


Nix package manager in LHCb - Chris
===================================
- Starting point: analysis preservation
  - Post-DaVinci environment tricky
  - Can’t run Docker everywhere
- [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/): "purely functional package manager"
  - Source based, but binary caches as well
- Package recipes:
  - Nix "expressions"
  - Few lines long in custom functional language
- Builds aim to be portable/reproducible/deterministic
- Everything stored in /nix by default
  - Each package lives in a directory named by hash of "how built"
- Collection of nix expressions = “channel”
  - Core/common is on [github NixOS/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs)
- Nixpkgs also provides helper functions for environment/symlinks for build/runtime
- Example expression show for Gaudi
  - Functional language => recipe is a function whose inputs are things like dependencies, sources, patches, etc
- Work so far
  - Nix in Docker without cvmfs mounted, but changing nix store to /cvmfs/lhcb.../nix (mock /cvmfs, not actually distributing over CVMFS yet)
  - Change in store root => official binary cache can’t be used, so need to rebuild (Chris: You can change store root if new path is same length!)
    - Graeme: so hash contains path prefix? Yes..
    - Binary cache is then install location dependent
      - Marco - so then a binary cache is a specific install location cache
      - /cvmfs/nix (or something like that) would be needed to share
    - Patrick: Supercomputers use "uncvmfs"; user space filesystems also help (e.g., parrot)
    - Total recompile does mean that it’s very clean, albeit with CPU cost for rebuilding
    - You don’t need to worry about platform variants (SLC6, CentOS7, etc.) as single build is self contained.
  - Package builds using Nix “Hydra” tool on openstack. Uses local machine for build, but easy to add additional worker(s)
    - Also supports for workers with different archs (darwin, or CPU variants etc)
  - Overlays: Take main NixPkgs repo, then apply your changes on top of this. Can extend or override.
    - Graeme: So can take things from base, but then change a few options? Yes.
  - Environment Overlays
    - "buildEnv" used to create environments. Symlinked to the store directory, similar to an LCG view.
    - Also allows integrating with package overlays, and special treatment for languages that have their own conventions like Python/Haskell.
- Examples given for installing Nix in Docker images, noted current limitations
  - Binary downloads are slow
  - Package signatures aren’t checked yet
  - Some packages have issues when built inside Docker images (test suites that require privileges)
- Why use nix?
  - Built software should run on “any” Linux flavour (own libc, "build almost everything" approach)
  - Simpler environments
  - Many packages already upstream in NixPkgs
  - Adding new packages is straight forward (many things like shebang patching, RUNPATH etc automagically handled)
  - Active community
- What isn’t so good
  - Documentation lacking, but is improving and many examples help
  - Nix language has a steep learning curve, but not so bad if just writing expressions
  - Some issues with independence from host system
    - Graphics, kernel (but no worse that others)
  - Sometimes reproducible builds aren’t reproducible (mostly due to remote file URLs being changed)
- Giulio
  - Not easy to use “system” or “private” pieces, e.g., a local compiler
  - Rebuild time is very long, if something changes
    - Incremental build use case
  - How to do my day to day development work?
    - Especially changing some mid-level component, e.g. ROOT but checking impact on AliPhysics (without rebuilding everything?)
      - AliBuild takes care of this
    - Chris - Hydra will allow you to download a bootstrap script that gives a local build environment, that could be tweaked locally
- Marco
  - User development should be in nix-shell
  - At the moment we are trapped on a single well controlled environment (e.g., lxplus) as we can’t really support non-native systems
  - Single tool to build and give a development environment is a big plus
- Pere
  - To build Gaudi, source an lcgview, then cmake && make - there is nothing easier
  - We are schizophrenic - we want perfect reproducibility, but also want to be able to patch things (e.g., new xrootd client)
  - How do we solve that problem?
  - Ben: lifecycle of different pieces is very different, physics makes numbers, middleware is a different matter (and breaks, can need changed)
  - This has pushed use from the system, instead of building everything
  - In nix can rebuild xrootd, but with new version?
- Marco - don’t like to have openssl, etc. in our stack as we are not in charge of updating them
  - How to install xrootd without recompiling everything?
  - Divide package sets in two and don’t introduce unnecessary dependencies (careful package management)
    - Setup a runtime that separates ROOT with ROOT xrootd plugin
    - Only rebuild pieces needed, recreate views
    - Does this actually work?
In favour of building everything, once, instead of having to support patching on many platforms.
- Guilherme - change openssl, it rebuilds, but only for packages with a direct dependency, otherwise not
- Can nix use system packages? On Mac, can use system libraries for Cocoa etc. No on Linux. Giulio: Might be possible to do this on Linux, but not the default.
- Boundary between package management and development - treat this with care…
- Graeme: We’re likely missing a few use cases, or rather, stories, that would be useful to enumerate. For example, if we have a reproducible rebuild, perhaps we shouldn’t be so afraid of rebuilding.
