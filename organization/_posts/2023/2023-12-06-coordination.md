## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

13-17 May at DESY is now confirmed for a joint WCLG-HSF workshop. News from WLCG to come soon. Note this will be the HSF's 10th birthday meeting!

### LHCC News

Only positive noises for software. Official minutes to come.

### ICFA Seminar

Graeme gave a talk on Software at the [ICFA Seminar](https://indico.desy.de/event/38293/) last week, as part of a whole session on Software and Computing. Very nice to see these topics being taken so seriously at this level.

## Working Group Updates

### Conveners for 2024

We extended the call for conveners until the end of next week, 15 December. *Please think about nominations and forward to others who might make nominations.*

Nominations to [HSF Search Committee](mailto:hsf-search-committee@cern.ch).

### Data Analysis

- Held meeting on HS3 (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) on Nov 27: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1348309/> with discussion notes in [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NizUogJpiTNxZ_-Pqf9heI-8ynv95s5UNtu_G6rLxsk/) (recording on CDS linked to agenda). Further feedback on the standard, especially from beyond the LHC, would be very welcomeâ€”please see slides for more information and where to get in touch.
- Have contacts with Belle II. Would be good to reach out to ePIC and DUNE.

### Detector Simulation
