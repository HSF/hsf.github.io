## News, general matters, announcements

### LHCC

#### RRB Reports

The text for the [RRB report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J-cfkgqP0ukbtlEQJEnZSzV3GVukVAPuONw1k261a6A/edit?usp=sharing) was submitted last week, covering software projects and HSF activities.

## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis

Experiment training paper, it's basically ready. Could go to Frontiers in Physics, special CHEP edition. Graeme will contact the editors.

Next meeting on [HS3](https://github.com/hep-statistics-serialization-standard/hep-statistics-serialization-standard), still to fix a date.

### Software Tools and Packaging

Meeting last week with Graeme Stewart, group conveners and Fermilab developers working on Spack integration: Marc Mengel and Chris Green.

Graeme and Marco will report in the [AF next week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1251048/) on the Spack state-of-nation (they have been speaking to quite a few groups).

Could consider presenting this round-up in a future packaging meeting.

### Detector Simulation

Had a [meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1321071/) on 18th September on G4 optimisation and tuning. Two interesting talks. Some discussion between experiments.

Would still like to have a meeting on physics model extensions.

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

No new updates (still planning 4D tracking talk and another session on "efficient computing").

### PyHEP

Abstract acceptances went out last week. Now finalising timetable for [the workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1252095/). Event will fill the 4 days.

### Frameworks

Have not yet settled on a date for a presentation regarding HPX.  We will likely have a talk in October regarding lessons learned on incorporating C++20 within the art framework.

### Physics Generators

- Preparing a meeting on shared elements between MCEGs
- Discussions on workshop for MCEGs in NHEP
  - This would have a broader focus than the [N(N)LO workshop at CERN in November](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1312061/)

### JuliaHEP

- [JuliaHEP WS preparation](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1292759/)
  - Preparing an initial block schedule
  - Decided to extend the abstract submission deadline to 9 October

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Compute Accelerator Forum

- 13 September meeting on [RISC-V](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264300/) was well received and the video is posted
- 11 October meeting will look at [D programming language](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264301/)
- 8 November meeting will be a presentation on [HEPiX benchmarking](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264302/)

### Software and Computing Roundtable

No progress on restating yet, but not forgotten!

## AOB

### Technical Note on Project Best Practices

The update on *Project Best Practices* will now be submitted to Zenodo. Last chance to [review](https://github.com/HSF/documents/blob/master/HSF-TN/2020-01/HSF-TN-2020-01.md) for this Friday.

### Website

Benedikt started an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

*We aim to try and have a new website ready for next year.*

### Community Calendar

As the autumn is now firmly entrenched, we should make sure the calendar is up to date with events for next year.

- [ ] ALICE
- [ ] ATLAS
- [ ] CMS
- [ ] LHCb
- [ ] EIC
- [ ] Belle II
- [ ] DUNE
- [ ] Conferences (ACAT and CHEP)
- [ ] LHCC Weeks

And anything else relevant for the software and computing communities in NHEP?

### EPIC

Went through a software decision process. Will be reviewed in October. Will need to make progress on *metadata*. Would like to work in the HSF context.

Paul Laycock would be a good contact, especially for the new metadata server used by sPHENIX that followed the HSF recommended design. (Work was [presented at CHEP](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/contributions/11326/).)

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be on [12 October](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225026/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - we need volunteers from now until the end of the year!
