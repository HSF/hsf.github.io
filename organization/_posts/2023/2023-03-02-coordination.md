## News, general matters, announcements

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

*Reminder!*

Confirmed with WLCG colleagues and LHC computing coordinators the two topics for a [pre-CHEP workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) on 6-7 May 2023 in Norfolk, VA.

- Analysis Facilities
- Non-x86 Computing

The scientific orgaising team are working on planning the event now (Ofer Rind, Alessandra Forti, Pepe Molina, Nicole Skidmore, Lukas Heinrich, Alexander Held, Diego Ciangottini; collectively hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch).

*Update report deferred to next meeting*

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

Next steps
* 1st round of selection on March 14
* Final selection in 1 month


### Google Season of Docs, 2023

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) has been announced. Deadline for the application is March 24. We still need to select which project to put forward this time. Proposals welcome.

It is possible to fold a few topics into one project, if that is optimal (as we did in 2022).

David: IRIS-HEP may have an idea, will let know in the coming week

### LHCC

For next week's meeting with the LHCC referees we got input from Geant4, ROOT and the experiments. The [draft](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Z9Vnp4d1qtin9qhTs_HEflIb0H1ytS5WaIk1b4097E0/edit?usp=sharing) was presented in today's [Architect's Forum](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1251042/).

### LHCP Invitation

We have been invited to give a talk at [LHCP](https://lhcp2023.ac.rs/) (May 22-26), in the Upgrade/Performance & Tools parallel session (20'+4'). Tentative title *Computing Challenges at the HL-LHC and Beyond*. The organisers strongly request in person presnce.

It's a great opportunity to advertise the HSF and get people more involved in common software activities. *Is anyone attending LHCP from the HSF and could give this talk?*

The coordination team would definitely help with preparing.

## Working Group Updates

### General

We now completed our team of conveners for 2023 - Giulia Casarosa (Belle II) joins the Reconstruction and Software Triggers WG.

Outgoing conveners are removed from the mailing list - thank you again for your contributions!

Can *working groups please submit a [website pull request](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/howto-website.html)*, updating their conveners (you can also think about updated group text).

Groups needing an update: Simulation, Reconstruction, Training

### Mailing Lists

Graeme looked at the current mailing lists, total membership and when people joined. See this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SaXuVFa6PJX_jEqlBjDniHTclwG3vnhjwF1J1ShhZtY/edit?usp=sharing) for the summary.

We could certainly do with re-advertising the lists as part of a re-engagement drive.

#### Meetings

*Reminder:* Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Data Analysis

Aiming to meet next week to start organizing meetings.


### Software Training

- Please fill out the [STATE OF TRAINING Survey](https://forms.gle/feFD4Xr9XQCPin8S6)


#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

New HEP C++ Course, "the Essentials" planned for 6 - 10 March <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1229412/> at CERN & zoom. Registration opened Monday 6 Feb 9h.  All places are taken (N.B. this time there is a 20CHF registration fee).

If you want to mentor please contact <mailto:stefan.roiser@cern.ch>

More courses planned in 2023:
- Week after CHEP @ JLAB (contact: Brad Sawatzky)
- Sep/Oct @ Manchester (contact: Caterina Doglioni)
- Fall "Advanced course" @ CERN

Would be nice to define these dates properly!

Are these courses local or residential? Need to explore resources and rediscuss this.

If you want stay informed about upcoming courses please sign up at <https://indico.cern.ch/e/HepCppInfo>. Announcements of new courses will be sent to registrants. 

### Detector Simulation

In the process of organizing sessions on:
- Geant4 cut tuning as done by experiments
- Overview of external (not Geant4) physics model developments
- Geant4 hadronic physics models and connections with event generators

### PyHEP

[PyHEP.dev](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2023.dev) registration is now open. July 25â€’28, 2023 at Princeton.
   
### Event Generators

In discussion about MCEG workshop with a focus on tuning.

### Frameworks

We had a meeting last week (<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1254020/>, recording posted) where Roel Aaij (Nikhef) presented on LHCb's GPU-based Allen framework.  About 20 participants with active discussion.  Next meeting will likely cover CMS' use of Alpaka.

## Other Interest and Activity Areas
