## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF-India

- Apologies, this is CMS week for some of us. We will try to be there in person
  today, but may not manage to be.
- A group of us (David Lange, Verena Martinez Outschoorn, Rafael Coelho Lopes de
  Sa, Peter Elmer) visited a number of universities/labs in India in early
  January. We met researchers and students to introduce our project. We had
  originally planned a central kick-off meeting, but decided to make individual
  site visits to reduce the barrier for interacting with us. Given that the
  HSF-India project that is not yet known, it would have been a big ask for
  people to travel to learn about it.
- We visited Mumbai (3 places), Pune, Kolkata (met people from 3-4 institutes in
  one place), Delhi and Aligarh. The HEP researchers we interacted with were
  mostly CMS, Alice and phenomenology, with a few doing neutrinos and Belle.
- We found lots of synergies with our proposed program.
- Next steps:
  - Organization of a week-long training-oriented event in Mumbai (TIFR),
    tentatively scheduled the week before CHEP (i.e. 1-5 May).
  - Writing a proposal for two week workshop at the ICTS conference facility in
    Bangalore. Would be summer 2024 or later. This facility hosts events,
    provides housing and other infrastructure.
  - Organizing our summer trainee program. We will soon seek project ideas where
    US/European researchers can work together with researchers in India to
    _co-mentor_ students (otherwise modeled after GSoC/IRIS-HEP like programs).
    We hope to engage 10-20 projects, More details soon (eg, next week).

- We are inviting potential (co-)mentors to join as "collaborators":

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

Confirmed with WLCG colleagues and LHC computing coordinators the two topics for
a [pre-CHEP workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) on 6-7 May 2023 in
Norfolk, VA.

- Analysis Facilities
- Non-x86 Computing

The scientific organising team are working on planning the event now (Ofer Rind,
Alessandra Forti, Pepe Molina, Nicole Skidmore, Lukas Heinrich, Alexander Held,
Diego Ciangottini; collectively
[hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch]<mailto:hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch>)

CHEP organisers will setup a modest Zoom connection with JLab AV equipment (hope
that people can at least follow the speaker, but maybe not discussions).

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

Google Summer of Code for 2023 is underway.

This year Benedikt Hegner (CERN) will head up the organising team. He will be
joined by Valentin Volkl (CERN), Baidyanath Kundu (Princeton) and Wouter
Deconinck (U Manitoba) - thanks to them all!

**For projects** we need to have proposals available by _7 February_, which is
now very close. So far we have only 3 proposals.

Tracking students from the outset (GitHub, GitLab, Linkedin, etc.) is a great
way to follow them after GSoC (IRIS-HEP do this for their fellows).

### Google Season of Docs, 2023

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) has been
announced. Deadline for the application is March 24. We still need to select
which project to put forward this time. Proposals welcome.

It is possible to fold a few topics into one project, if that is optimal (as we
did in 2022).

## Working Group Updates

### General

We have almost concluded for the WG conveners for 2023.

- Alex Held will join the Data Analysis WG
- Claire Antel will join the Reconstruction and Software Trigger WG

#### Meetings

_Reminder:_ Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly
email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Software Training

- Please see slides on the [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225008/).
- Please fill out the

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

New HEP C++ Course, "the Essentials" planned for 6 - 10 March
<https://indico.cern.ch/event/1229412/> at CERN & zoom. Registration should open
next Monday 6 Feb 9am

New: we will run the course on Mo, We, Fr, leap days meant to work on the
remaining examples. We also plan to charge a small registration fee of CHF 20.

If you want to mentor please contact <mailto:stefan.roiser@cern.ch>

More courses planned in 2023:

- Week after CHEP @ JLAB (contact: Brad Sawatzky)
- Sep/Oct @ Manchester (contact: Caterina Doglioni)
