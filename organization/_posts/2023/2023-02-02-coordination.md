## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF-India

- Apologies, this is CMS week for some of us. We will try to be there in person today, but may not manage to be.
- A group of us (David Lange, Verena Martinez Outschoorn, Rafael Coelho Lopes de Sa, Peter Elmer) visited a number of universities/labs in India in early January. We met researchers and students to introduce our project. We had originally planned a central kick-off meeting, but decided to make individual site visits to reduce the barrier for interacting with us. Given that the HSF-India project that is not yet known, it would have been a big ask for people to travel to learn about it.
- We visited Mumbai (3 places), Pune, Kolkata (met people from 3-4 institutes in one place), Delhi and Aligarh. The HEP researchers we interacted with were mostly CMS, Alice and phenomenology, with a few doing neutrinos and Belle.
- We found lots of synergies with our proposed program. 
- Next steps:
  - Organization of a week-long training-oriented event in Mumbai (TIFR), tentatively scheduled the week before CHEP (i.e. 1-5 May).
  - Writing a proposal for two week workshop at the ICTS conference facility in Bangalore. Would be summer 2024 or later. This facility hosts events, provides housing and other infrastructure.
  - Organizing our summer trainee program. We will soon seek project ideas where US/European researchers can work together with researchers in India to *co-mentor* students (otherwise modeled after GSoC/IRIS-HEP like programs). We hope to engage 10-20 projects, More details soon (eg, next week).
- Primordial Website: [http://research-software-collaborations.org](http://research-software-collaborations.org)
- We are inviting potential (co-)mentors to join as "collaborators": ([link with documentation](http://research-software-collaborations.org/docs/newteammember.html))

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

Confirmed with WLCG colleagues and LHC computing coordinators the two topics for a [pre-CHEP workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) on 6-7 May 2023 in Norfolk, VA.

- Analysis Facilities
- Non-x86 Computing

The scientific organising team are working on planning the event now (Ofer Rind, Alessandra Forti, Pepe Molina, Nicole Skidmore, Lukas Heinrich, Alexander Held, Diego Ciangottini; collectively [hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch]<mailto:hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch>)

CHEP organisers will setup a modest Zoom connection with JLab AV equipment (hope that people can at least follow the speaker, but maybe not discussions).

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

Google Summer of Code for 2023 is underway.

This year Benedikt Hegner (CERN) will head up the organising team. He will be joined by Valentin Volkl (CERN), Baidyanath Kundu (Princeton) and Wouter Deconinck (U Manitoba) - thanks to them all!

**For projects** we need to have proposals available by *7 February*, which is now very close. So far we have only 3 proposals.

Tracking students from the outset (GitHub, GitLab, Linkedin, etc.) is a great way to follow them after GSoC (IRIS-HEP do this for their fellows).

### Google Season of Docs, 2023

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) has been announced. Deadline for the application is March 24. We still need to select which project to put forward this time. Proposals welcome.

It is possible to fold a few topics into one project, if that is optimal (as we did in 2022).

## Working Group Updates

### General

We have almost concluded for the WG conveners for 2023.

- Alex Held will join the Data Analysis WG
- Claire Antel will join the Reconstruction and Software Trigger WG

#### Meetings

*Reminder:* Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Software Training
