## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

## Working Group Updates

#### Website banners

We have the ability to put event banners on the HSF website. All it requires is a markdown file with the event data. See, e.g., files [here](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/tree/main/announcements/_posts/2023).

#### Meetings

Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Conveners for 2024

Sent call for nominations last week. Very little feedback.

Claire volunteered for the search committee. Thanks!

### Data Analysis

Aiming to set up HS3 meeting on Nov 20 (confirmation / announcement to follow).
 
### Software Tools and Packaging
- Trying to advertise the EESSI tutorial on CVMFS for HPC admins
    - <https://event.ugent.be/registration/event/84b45c41-b98b-4a41-9aae-60f5f9e89440>
- Meeting on Spack developments to be organised.

### Detector Simulation
- Currently planned/scheduled sessions:
    * Summary of the fast calorimeter challenge workshop and fast calorimeter simulation in ATLAS; some time in November/December.
    * Next FLUKA generation and its tangible convergences with Geant4 on December 11th. Indico link: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338814/>.

### PyHEP
- Last week we discussed the organisation of the PyHEP.dev 2024 developers workshop with our co-organisers from Aachen, Germany. Dates around the end of August and the beginning of September (more likely the former) to be confirmed once we finalise on the venue.

### Physics Generators
- Generator  Workshop 13-14 November - <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1312061/>.

### JuliaHEP
- Workshop [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1292759/timetable/#20231106) currently happening.


## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Compute Accelerator Forum


### Software and Computing Roundtable

Torre - good intentions to restart it haven't resulted in a restart, EIC/ePIC too busy. Still intend to restart it, we hope at the beginning of 2024.

## AOB

### Website

There is an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

*We aim to try and have a new website ready for next year.*

### Community Calendar

As the autumn is now firmly entrenched, we should make sure the calendar is up to date with events for next year.

- [ ] ALICE
- [x] ATLAS
- [ ] CMS
- [x] LHCb
- [ ] EIC
- [ ] Belle II
- [ ] DUNE
- [x] Conferences (ACAT and CHEP - others?)
- [x] LHCC Weeks

And anything else relevant for the software and computing communities in NHEP.

#### EUCAIFCon: 30/04-3/05/2024

European AI for Fundamental Physics Conference (EuCAIFCon) - 30 April to 3 May 2024

[https://inspirehep.net/conferences/2710084](https://inspirehep.net/conferences/2710084)

Some background: this is a JENAA (Joint ECFA/NuPECC/APPEC Activity) Expression of Interest that started around the time of the Bologna ECFA computing workshop. The aim is to advance the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Fundamental Physics. 

Some early details are on [https://www.eucaif.org](https://www.eucaif.org) and it will eventually appear [here](https://nupecc.org/jenaa/?display=eois). 

Caterina is in the organising committee, and would like to find a way to connect HSF training / PyHEP as foundations to use of ML in HEP. Feedback/other ideas? 

#### GSOC Mentor Summit Summary

* Recent changes to the GSoC programme (non-students can participate, can move evaluation deadlines) seem to be working well.
* For next year: small projects in addition to medium and large.
* If you are interested in Google Season of Docs, let me (Valentin Volkl) know.
* HSF in 2023: Fewer accepted projects (17) but very successful, 14 already positively evaluated, remaining 3 on track to finish in November.
    * One student could not accept stipend due to tax reasons (moved to the US).


### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be on [23 November]( https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225029/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - we need volunteers from now until the end of the year!
