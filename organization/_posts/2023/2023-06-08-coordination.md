## News, general matters, announcements

### LHCP Presentation

Vangelis Kourlitis presented a [talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1198609/contributions/5370078/) on *HL-LHC and Beyond Computing Challenges*.

Questions raised regarding:

- ATLAS - Google Cloud Platform project and future
- Common fast-simulation software à la ACTS
- CO2 emissions of our disks usage

- *Discussion:* disk energy consumption is much less than CPU. See [A holistic study of the WLCG energy needs for the LHC scientific program](https://indico.jlab.org/event/459/contributions/11499/attachments/9236/14205/WLCGEnergyNeedsCHEP2023.pdf) talk at CHEP2023 (slide 9).

### LHCC

Alessandra Forti, one of the Analysis Facilities Forum co-conveners, presented the status of Analysis Facilities in the community ([slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225017/attachments/2552956/4612708/20230605_LHCC_AF_progress_report-8.pdf) attached).

There was a very productive discussion between the referees, the experiments, WLCG and HSF at the special session.

LHCC thanked the Analysis Facilities Forum for their work bringing the R&D around analysis facilities into the light.

In the whole community, we should take care to balance the R&D with production activities at the sites. Modernising infrastructure, helped by this type of R&D, is already a valuable outcome.

To demonstrate the new analysis facility concepts work, they need to be tested on representative used cases *at scale*. LHCC asks the experiments to provide a document on analysis use cases, which can be matched to AFs, then using this to develop benchmarks.

- The exact parameters of this document will come later, in consultation with the LHCC's HL-LHC review committee.

*Long discussion on this point, we conclude that the LHCC are positive about the R&D and would like to get more formal engagement from the experiments, folding these studies into HL-LHC planning. We think the concerns raised by the LHCC (balance R&D against production; establish clear use cases and needs) are not new, but this actually means that we are investigating the right topics and sending the right messages.*

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

The projects have started and students are working. Would like to find a person to attend the mentors' summit meeting and discuss the procedure for that.

If people need access to CERN resources contact Yasemin, the EP-SFT secretary.

Want to have an early meeting with the students, not just at the end of the coding period.

## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis

- Planning for a meeting focused on Open Data from LHC experiments on July 3rd, 15:00 CET (now drafting emails to identify speakers).
- Considering possibility of a talk on Julia following the Julia white paper, does that sound of interest?
  - Yes, we think that is a good idea
    - Could have some generic Julia info + dedicated HEP libraries + pointer to new HSF Julia group

### Software Training

- Most recent software basics carpentry training: 18-19 May
  - 150 registrations -> 65 participants through the end
  - Lessons learned: slack for online discussions work well; ssh keys for github interaction, learners on WSL need more attention
    - Little things go wrong for them and it's enough to trip up beginners
- HSF Training materials now instrumented with Plausible web analysis
  - Initial look at first week of data: many deep link arrivals into modern cmake training, not many visitors from curriculum landing page
  - Will work with DAWG to integrate links to HSF training resource links better into experiment-specific training materials
- Two training fellows actively working on:
  - REANA training evaluation and improvement
  - pytest training development
- Next software basics carpentry training: 12-14 July
- Further into the future:
  - Analysis Preservation training workshop: mid-September
  - Matplotlib training workshop: mid-October

### Software Tools and Packaging

- Hope to have Adam Stewart, the person who maintains Python package packaging in Spack, come to CERN in September and give a talk. He is starting a postdoc at Technical University of Munich.

### Detector Simulation

- Held a meeting dedicated to Geant4 physics models and event generators on June 5th: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1276128/>
  - Quite good attendance, 19 people in total; Both from the detector simulation and generator community. (Several other meetings prevented more people from attending.)
- Still following up on possible contributions on Geant4 cuts/optimizations implemented by experiments (Two identified)
- Still following up on possible contributions on Geant4 Physics extensions that experiments have developed (One identified)

### Frameworks

- CMSSW talk on incorporating Alpaka into framework jobs  has been rescheduled for [28 June](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1281987/).

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### JuliaHEP

- The paper *Potential of the Julia programming language for high energy physics computing* was submitted Tuesday to the Computing and Software for Big Science journal. You can find the preprint on arXiv: <http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03675>.
  - Feedback is very positive so far.
- Some of us met last week to discuss the **creation of a new JuliaHEP working group** in HSF. Decided on the following:

  - The following people volunteer to be the conveners of the new working group:
    - Tamás Gál (Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics, Erlangen-Nurenberg, Germany)
    - Alexander Moreno (Universidad Antonio Nariño, Ibagué, Colombia)
    - Uwe Hernandez Acosta (Center for Advanced Systems Understanding, Görlitz, Germany)
    - Pere Mato (CERN, Switzerland)
  - Start organizing the first JuliaHEP workshop
    - 6-9 November 2023 at ECAP (Erlangen Centre for Astroparticle Physics)
  - Start entry point documentation for JuliaHEP at <https://www.juliahep.org>
  - Fill in [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19Q3bWnumKLkfG4FyhLidv3IGhQq01azFQzvInL-Ty8o/edit#) with projects we are interested to do
  - Sign up to [Discourse](https://discourse.julialang.org) and Slack if you aren't already!
  - Move to the JuliaHEP mailing list: <julia-hep@googlegroups.com>

- Created a [page](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/juliahep.html) in the HSF web side with the information on JuliaHEP

### Compute Accelerator Forum

Next week we will hear from the DOE funded HEP CCE project, which is now reaching the end of its first funding phase.

- Charles Leggett will present results on portable parallelisation layers
- Peter Van Gemmeren will present results on high-performance I/O

[Meeting will be held jointly with ATLAS Core Software in Salle Curie](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264297/), Wenesday 14 June at 16h30.

### Visualisation

The [Phoenix Event Display](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix) will be featured in the next CERN Courier.

## AOB

### Website

Benedikt started an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be, on [22 June](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225018/).

Please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings.
