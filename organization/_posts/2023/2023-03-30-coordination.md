## News, general matters, announcements

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

Lots of people attending (~150+ registered), so switched from initial idea of group discussions to plenary style. Identified a list of topics and suitable speakers, with in-person presentations: [indico agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1230126/timetable/#20230506.detailed).

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

Next steps:

- Final student proposals are due for April 4, i.e. next week.

### Google Season of Docs, 2023

Submission by CVMFS project by Valentin and we are waiting.

## Working Group Updates

### General

After we finish all the WG presentations we should update the HSF Planning page, and advertise this and the WG mailing lists to the community.

#### Meetings

*Reminder:* Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Software Training

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

Post-CHEP course still under preparation.

### Detector Simulation

Updated web-page with convener information

In the process of organizing sessions on:

- Geant4 cut tuning as done by experiments (discussion with potential speakers started)
- Overview of external (not Geant4) physics model developments (invitation sent; no news)
- Geant4 hadronic physics models and connections with event generators (news: speaker identified, the talk to be scheduled sometime after CHEP)

There is a [Geant4 technical forum 6.4.2023](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1266537/). All are welcome and virtual participation is possible.

### Event Generators

Still need to organize the tuning tutorial and also the general physics generators workshop.

### Frameworks

Still need to pin down CMSSW accelerator integration talk.

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Licensing

Any follow up on CUDA on CVMFS question since last meeting (March 16)? --> question for Stefan Roiser.
