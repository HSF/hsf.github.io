## News, general matters, announcements

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

This is pretty much all ready to go now. See
[indico](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) for final agenda. The Zoom
connection is available but this is primarily an in-person event - remote
connection should be ok for talks, not so good for discussion.

We plan to circulate the AFF report (it's almost ready) and a list of topical
questions re. heterogeneous resources in advance to that we know what we are
trying to achieve. _Should be circulated tomorrow._

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

- 66 proposals for ~39 projects received
- 22 projects selected at least one candidate
- passed a sorted list of these 22 requests to Google.
- Vastly different quality of proposals and proposal writing
- Our ranking is based on mentor assessment on the candidate, mentor assessment
  on the proposal and admin team assessment on the proposal
- Two proposals were in the eyes of the admin team borderline in quality.
  Decided to request them nevertheless. Given the non-kept deadline by the
  mentors, there was not sufficient time to discuss till the Google deadline. We
  did not want to penalize students and thus kept the proposals.
- As in previous years, need to have sufficient redundancy in communication as
  emails are rarely read fully.

## Working Group Updates

### General

The planning summary for 2023 is
[published](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/planning/plan-of-work-2023.html) -
thanks to all for input and reviewing.

#### Meetings

_Reminder:_ Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly
email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Data Analysis

Training paper now has contributions from LHCb, CMS, Belle II

- If we can get ATLAS contribution happy to proceed with these 4 contributions
  (ie. without EIC or Dune contributions)

Allie will give an associated CHEP talk and circulate slides to the all on the
paper email thread in the next days

### Software Training

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- Manchester course logistics sorted out (see past minutes)
  - Question before we advertise: is this a UK-targeted course? Or do we open to
    everyone?
    - 50 participants limit

### Software Tools and Packaging

- Had an internal meeting planning a spack meeting before the summer and a
  meeting on python packaging

### Detector Simulation

- A talk on Geant4 physics models and event generators tentatively scheduled for
  June 5th <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1276128/>
- Still following up on possible contributions on G4 Physics extensions that
  experiments have developed (One identified).
- Still following up on possible contributions on Geant4 optimizations
  implemented by experiments (One identified).

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

Kick-off meeting happened yesterday (26/04/2023) from 2-3pm CEST

- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1273894/
- ~20 mins of presentation followed by a very nice discussion session
- ~ 20 people connected for the whole duration (max 24), large representation
  from our experiments, will work harder on advertising outside for the future
- New additions of subjects of interest in the
  [google-doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v03aQRlKfTxcXTYb6Stf_cpqklt7e-FznmIUEw5Ec9o/edit)
- Meeting was recorded, is there an HSF archive for meeting recordings? Any
  other way we could make it available to people? (Can't you use
  videos.cern.ch?)

- Started planning for next meeting, targeting mid-June with 4-D tracking in
  Belle II as a potential subjects. Could become more general with some
  contributions from the LHC timing upgrades.

### Event Generators

- Tuning tutorial - started contacting potential contributors and trying to fix
  the date(s).

### Frameworks

Still trying to secure talk from CMS re. their adoption of Alpaka. Will start
moving onto other topics we wanted to cover this year (e.g. language features,
alternatives to TBB).

### Compute Accelerator Forum

Had a meeting yesterday, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264290/>:

- CADNA, tool for studying numerical precision (Fabienne Jézéquel, Sorbonne)
- The case for AI-augmented facilities (Michael Bussmann, HZDR)

[Next meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264297/) is post-CHEP, 14 June, on
_HEPIX Benchmarking Project_, Domenico Giordano (CERN) - including how to
benchmark GPU and other accelerated workloads.

### Conditions Databases

A draft of the long-awaited conditions DB use cases, workflows and requirements
document will be discussed at a meeting next
[Tuesday afternoon at CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1280790/). The
reference implementation that will be presented at CHEP will also be discussed
during the meeting.

## AOB

### Website

Benedikt started an
[issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather
ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas
of actual activity.

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be after CHEP, on
[25 May](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225016/). (11 May meeting is cancelled.)

Please
