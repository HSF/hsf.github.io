## News, general matters, announcements

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

This is pretty much all ready to go now. See [indico](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) for final agenda. The Zoom connection is available but this is primarily an in-person event - remote connection should be ok for talks, not so good for discussion.

We plan to circulate the AFF report (it's almost ready) and a list of topical questions re. heterogeneous resources in advance to that we know what we are trying to achieve. *Should be circulated tomorrow.*

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

- 66 proposals for ~39 projects received
- 22 projects selected at least one candidate
- passed a sorted list of these 22 requests to Google. 
- Vastly different quality of proposals and proposal writing
- Our ranking is based on mentor assessment on the candidate, mentor assessment on the proposal and admin team assessment on the proposal
- Two proposals were in the eyes of the admin team borderline in quality. Decided to request them nevertheless. Given the non-kept deadline by the mentors, there was not sufficient time to discuss till the Google deadline. We did not want to penalize students and thus kept the proposals.
- As in previous years, need to have sufficient redundancy in communication as emails are rarely read fully.

## Working Group Updates

### General

The planning summary for 2023 is [published](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/planning/plan-of-work-2023.html) - thanks to all for input and reviewing.

#### Meetings

*Reminder:* Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Data Analysis

Training paper now has contributions from LHCb, CMS, Belle II

* If we can get ATLAS contribution happy to proceed with these 4 contributions (ie. without EIC or Dune contributions)

Allie will give an associated CHEP talk and circulate slides to the all on the paper email thread in the next days

### Software Training

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- Manchester course logistics sorted out (see past minutes)
  - Question before we advertise: is this a UK-targeted course? Or do we open to everyone? 
    - 50 participants limit

### Software Tools and Packaging

- Had an internal meeting planning a spack meeting before the summer and a meeting on python packaging

### Detector Simulation

- A talk on Geant4 physics models and event generators tentatively scheduled for June 5th <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1276128/>
- Still following up on possible contributions on G4 Physics extensions that experiments have developed (One identified).
- Still following up on possible contributions on Geant4 optimizations implemented by experiments (One identified).

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

Kick-off meeting happened yesterday (26/04/2023) from 2-3pm CEST

- https://indico.cern.ch/event/1273894/
- ~20 mins of presentation followed by a very nice discussion session
- ~ 20 people connected for the whole duration (max 24), large representation from our experiments, will work harder on advertising outside for the future
- New additions of subjects of interest in the [google-doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v03aQRlKfTxcXTYb6Stf_cpqklt7e-FznmIUEw5Ec9o/edit)
- Meeting was recorded, is there an HSF archive for meeting recordings? Any other way we could make it available to people? (Can't you use videos.cern.ch?)

- Started planning for next meeting, targeting mid-June with 4-D tracking in Belle II as a potential subjects. Could become more general with some contributions from the LHC timing upgrades.

### Event Generators

- Tuning tutorial - started contacting potential contributors and trying to fix the date(s).

### Frameworks

Still trying to secure talk from CMS re. their adoption of Alpaka.  Will start moving onto other topics we wanted to cover this year (e.g. language features, alternatives to TBB).

### Compute Accelerator Forum

Had a meeting yesterday, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264290/>:

- CADNA, tool for studying numerical precision (Fabienne Jézéquel, Sorbonne)
- The case for AI-augmented facilities (Michael Bussmann, HZDR)

[Next meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264297/) is post-CHEP, 14 June, on *HEPIX Benchmarking Project*, Domenico Giordano (CERN) - including how to benchmark GPU and other accelerated workloads.

### Conditions Databases

A draft of the long-awaited conditions DB use cases, workflows and requirements document will be discussed at a meeting next [Tuesday afternoon at CERN](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1280790/).  The reference implementation that will be presented at CHEP will also be discussed during the meeting.

## AOB

### Website

Benedikt started an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be after CHEP, on [25 May](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225016/). (11 May meeting is cancelled.)

Please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings.
