## News, general matters, announcements

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

First round of student reports [today 16h CEST](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1318436/).

### LHCC

#### September LHCC

Kilian Lieret agreed to present the status of training in HEP to the LHCC for the September meeting.

Draft slides are [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1v6am9c_JV43Qy3EeZ6ABtUtOT2AGxvo07zSqIyBKphA/edit?usp=sharing). Comments by Monday 4 September please!

#### November LHCC

Parameters for the generators focus topic for the LHCC in November workshop are being finalised - should be available in the next few days. This will follow-up on issues identified as part of the HL-LHC review process (negative weights, computational performance, etc.) and will include input from the experiments about their needs.

Discussions at the [Event generators' and N(n)LO codes' acceleration](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1312061/) workshop (13-14 November) will be important preparation!

#### RRB Reports

The text for the RRB report (covering 20 March - 21 September) is due 22 September. Graeme and Predrag are organising inputs from the projects and the HSF. Graeme will write the HSF report, so if you have anything you want to highlight please let him know.

## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis

Rest of the year plans:

- Publish Training whitepaper
- Start HS3 (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) meeting series
  - Possibly dedicated meeting on template smoothing
- Open data follow-up meeting, probably January

### Software Training

- [Software Basics](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1316853/), 13-14 November

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- [Training in Manchester](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1266661/) is running this week!
- [Advanced C++ course](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1266628/) at CERN will run in October

### Software Tools and Packaging

- Presentation next Tuesday 5 Sept 2023 17:00 CERN time
Tom Eichlersmith from the University of Minnesota will present us his "denv" tool wrapping different container interfaces: <https://github.com/tomeichlersmith/denv>.

### Detector Simulation

- [Next working group meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1321071/) scheduled 18.09.2023 - 17:30 (CERN time)
  - Topic is discussing approaches / sharing knowledge about Geant4 client-side tuning (step-count reduction)
  - 2 speakers: Walter Hopkins (ATLAS), Benedikt Volkel (ALICE)

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Topical Meeting on _sustainability_ confirmed for Sept 13th 2-3 pm CEST with a presentation by Ana Lucia Varbanescu
  - Topics: zero waste computing,  how we can improve the efficiency in the design and implementation of large-scale reconstruction & trigger software for current and future HEP experiments?
  - [Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1320368/) is setup, will soon send e-mail to invite people, after we have converged on the title of the talk

### PyHEP

PyHEP2023 workshop in October. Will send a reminder about abstracts as the number is currently low. Aware of many topics, including follow-ups from the PyHEP.dev meeting.

German institute has offered to host PyHEP.dev 2024 next year.

Will think about topical meetings for after the workshop.

### Frameworks

Would still like to have a presentation on HPX in September, but exact date not yet fixed.

### Physics Generators

Next steps:

- The tuning workshop has been successful. We could recap the workshop in our next meeting and discuss follow up next steps.
- Standards for shared elements has a lot of potential. We should have a meeting on that but could also consider a mini workshop (an afternoon at CERN, a morning in the US).

May be a bit longer term:

- On other follow up points on LHCC and Snowmass/P5
- Follow up of the 2018 event generators workshop at the end of the year or early next year.
  - Discussion: For the [LPCC NNLO Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1312061/), Phil is an organiser. After that meeting and the LHCC there may be good points to follow up on at a future HSF Generators workshop.

### JuliaHEP

- No news since the summer break.
- Workshop 6-9 November
  - 61 registrations (~13 local participation)
  - Need to have a new round of advertisements encouraging beginners to register.
- CSBS paper has been accepted for publication

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Compute Accelerator Forum

- Next meeting will be 13 September with a presentation on [RISC-V architecture](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1264300/).

### Software and Computing Roundtable

Plan to restart these meetings in September.

## AOB

### Technical Note on Project Best Practices

We added a [new section](https://github.com/HSF/documents/pull/148) to the project TN on [CITATION.cff files](https://citation-file-format.github.io).

It would be good if people took 5 minutes to [review the advice](https://github.com/HSF/documents/blob/master/HSF-TN/2020-01/HSF-TN-2020-01.md) there and suggest any additions before we publish the update.

### Website

Benedikt started an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be on [September 14](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225024/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - we need volunteers from now until the end of the year!
