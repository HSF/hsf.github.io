## News, general matters, announcements

### JENA Computing Meeting

JENA Computing Meeting [took place last week](https://agenda.infn.it/event/34738/timetable/) in Bologna. About 70 people attended, from High-Energy Physics, Astroparticle and Nuclear Physics. The meeting had a European focus, with worldwide implications; the OSG was represented (Frank Wuerthwein). Nuclear physics community was European: FAIR, GANIL. Astroparticle was CTA, Rubin, Einstein. We are in contact with SKA, as they will be a big player.

Motivation: at the Joint ECFA-NuPECC-APPEC (JENA) Seminar in [May 2022 in Madrid](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1040535/), both the plenary presentations and the closed session of funding agency representatives revealed that there is an increased need for discussions on the strategy and implementation of European federated computing at future large-scale research facilities.

Goals: identify the computing requirements in the next decade and identify synergies that can benefit all the three communities (HEP, Nuclear Physics and Astrophysics).

Conclusions: we identified 5 areas that will be followed up on in working groups, with the aim of each topic providing a chapter that will form a JENA Whitepaper, in advance of the next symposium (Spring 2025) and before the next European Strategy Update.

- HPC centres and the integration of HPC resources with our computing infrastructures (Simone Campana and Gonzalo Merino lead)
- Software and Heterogeneous Architectures (Graeme Stewart will lead)
- Federate Data Management, Virtual Research Environments and FAIR/Open Data (ESCAPE project will lead)
- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (TBD, but concentrating on resource and service implications)
- Training, Dissemination, Education

If you are interested in joining one of these WGs, please email Graeme, Simone and Gonzalo.

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

- Representative for the mentors summit to be decided.

## Working Group Updates

### General

#### Website banners

Remember we have the ability to put event banners on the HSF website. All it requires is a markdown file with the event data. See, e.g., files [here](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/tree/main/announcements/_posts/2023).

### Data Analysis

- Will have meeting dedicated to Open Data on 3rd July with contributions for 4 LHC experiments
    - <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1298400/>
    - Mail sent to Google HSF Data Analysis group
        - Can it also be advertised in the general HSF mail please :)
        - Yes, just post it!

### Software Training

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- [Training in Manchester](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1266661/) is finalised, registration is open
- [Advanced C++ course](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1266628/) at CERN will run in October

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Nothing concrete yet but were considering inviting  speaker who gave [nice talk](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1198609/contributions/5366525/attachments/2654042/4595921/ALVarbanescu_ZeroWaste_May23_toPublish.pdf) on "zero-waste computing" at LHCP

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### JuliaHEP

- The JuliaHEP workshop announcement was made:

```txt
The first ever Julia HEP Workshop is now open for
registrations and we are eagerly awaiting your 
abstracts for talks and tutorials.

It will be a four day long hybrid event from 6-9th 
November 2023 hosted at the Erlangen Centre for 
Astroparticle Physics (ECAP) in Erlangen, Germany. The 
workshop is intended for everyone working in high-
energy physics or related fields. 

For registration and abstract submission, please visit 
https://indico.cern.ch/e/juliahep2023 There is no 
registration fee for online participants.

Important deadlines:

    - 25th September: Submission deadline for contributions
    - 8th October: Registration deadline for local participation
    - 6th November: Registration deadline for online participation

More information about the JuliaHEP Organisation: 
https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/juliahep.html

More details on the program including invited talks 
will follow soon after the submission deadline (25th 
September).

Feel free to forward this announcement to people who 
might be interested.

Looking forward to your participation!

## AOB

### Website

Benedikt started an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

### Next Meeting

The next meeting will be, on [6 July](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1225019/). N.B. At CERN we will meet in **40/R-B10** for that meeting.

Please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings.
