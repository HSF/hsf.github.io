## News, general matters, announcements

### Pre-CHEP Workshop

*Reminder!*

Confirmed with WLCG colleagues and LHC computing coordinators the two topics for a [pre-CHEP workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf23) on 6-7 May 2023 in Norfolk, VA.

- Analysis Facilities
- Non-x86 Computing

The scientific organising team are working on planning the event now (Ofer Rind, Alessandra Forti, Pepe Molina, Nicole Skidmore, Lukas Heinrich, Alexander Held, Diego Ciangottini; collectively <mailto:hsf-wlcg-2023-workshop@cern.ch>).

*Aim for a progress report next meeting*

### Google Summer of Code, 2023

Our application has been submitted based on 25 projects (compared to 40 last year!). Now waiting for the announcement by Google about accepted organizations (Feb 22).

No computing infrastructure projects this year - these were the projects that had poor success last year.

### Google Season of Docs, 2023

[Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs) has been announced. Deadline for the application is March 24. We still need to select which project to put forward this time. Proposals welcome.

It is possible to fold a few topics into one project, if that is optimal (as we did in 2022).

### LHCC

Liz and Graeme were in discussions with the LHCC Referees (and the LHC Computing Coordinators) and we decided that we will focus on common software projects w.r.t. progress since the LHCC HL-LHC review.

- March LHCC will focus on Simulation and ROOT I/O
- September LHCC will focus on Analysis and Generators

The referees also indicated they would like to focus on *Analysis Facilities* in *June*, which is excellent timing given the pre-CHEP workshop.

The WLCG 6-monthly report is due for 20 March. Liz and Graeme can prepare 1/2 page on HSF activities, but if you would like us to highlight anything in particular, please let us know. (Ref: [inputs from 2022H2](https://wlcg-docs.web.cern.ch/reporting/status_progress/Quarterly-Reports/2022/2022H2/SOFTWARE-2022H2.pdf).)

## Working Group Updates

### General

We still have one open convener position for the *Reconstruction and Software Trigger* WG. Please let us (Liz, Michel, Benedikt, Graeme) know if you would be interested or would like to make a nomination here.

We shall now remove outgoing conveners from the mailing list - thank you again for your contributions!

Can *working groups please submit a [website pull request](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/howto-website.html)*, updating their conveners (you can also think about updated group text).

#### Meetings

*Reminder:* Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Data Analysis

See slides on the agenda...

- Liz, CMS data analysis survey end of Run 1. It involved a lot of arm twisting to get people to respond. Could reuse the question set? (Though some questions would be very CMS specific.)
- Bring in contacts from each experiment as part of the process.
- Graeme - a polling company would randomly sample! Could we use CHEP to have an organising BoF session?

Next step, organise a meeting to start this process, with a follow-up at CHEP.

### Software Training

- Please fill out the [STATE OF TRAINING Survey](https://forms.gle/feFD4Xr9XQCPin8S6)
- Talk with group from Valencia who want to use our Analysis Preservation Material (and our instructors) for an in-person 3 day event
- Submitted [GSoC abstract about new Training Center webpage](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/gsoc/2023/proposal_HSFTraining_central_entry_point.html)
  - Benedikt - would this be suitable for Season of Docs?
  - Kilian - not sure it's in scope, but can consider
- Might have some funding for US based student(s) to work on training material. Possible projects to highlight:
    - *Analysis Preservation* (REANA, pytest, ...)
    - *Python at Scale* (performant python/HPC for HEP/...)
    - *ML + GPU*
    - *Julia* (?)

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

New HEP C++ Course, "the Essentials" planned for 6 - 10 March <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1229412/> at CERN & zoom. Registration opened Monday 6 Feb 9h.  82/100 places are booked (N.B. this time there is a 20CHF registration fee).

If you want to mentor please contact <mailto:stefan.roiser@cern.ch>

More courses planned in 2023:
- Week after CHEP @ JLAB (contact: Brad Sawatzky)
- Sep/Oct @ Manchester (contact: Caterina Doglioni)
- Fall "Advanced course" @ CERN

Would be nice to confirm these dates properly!

Are these courses local or residential? Need to explore resources and rediscuss this.

If you want stay informed about upcoming courses please sign up at <https://indico.cern.ch/e/HepCppInfo>. Announcements of new courses will be sent to registrants.

### Detector Simulation

Planning sessions on:

- Geant4 cut tuning as done by experiments
- Overview of external (not Geant4) physics model developments 
- Geant4 and event generators

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Discussion with future and past conveners at 16h today

### PyHEP

[PyHEP.dev](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2023.dev) registration is now open. July 25â€’28, 2023 at Princeton.

### Frameworks
