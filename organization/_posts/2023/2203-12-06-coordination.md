## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

13-17 May at DESY is now confirmed for a joint WCLG-HSF workshop. News from WLCG to come soon. Note this will be the HSF's 10th birthday meeting!

### LHCC News

Only positive comments for software during the meeting. Official minutes will come soon.

### ICFA Seminar

Graeme gave a talk on Software at the [ICFA Seminar](https://indico.desy.de/event/38293/) last week, as part of a whole session on Software and Computing. Very nice to see these topics being taken so seriously at this level. <!-- markdown-link-check-disable-line -->

## Working Group Updates

### Conveners for 2024

We extended the call for conveners until the end of next week, 15 December. *Please think about nominations and forward to others who might make nominations.*

Nominations to [HSF Search Committee](mailto:hsf-search-committee@cern.ch).

### Data Analysis

- Held meeting on HS3 (HEP Statistics Serialization Standard) on Nov 27: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1348309/> with discussion notes in [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NizUogJpiTNxZ_-Pqf9heI-8ynv95s5UNtu_G6rLxsk/) (recording on CDS linked to agenda). Further feedback on the standard, especially from beyond the LHC, would be very welcome—please see slides for more information and where to get in touch.
- Have contacts with Belle II. Would be good to reach out to ePIC and DUNE.

### Detector Simulation
