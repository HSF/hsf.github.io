## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Evolution

Steering group met last week to progress on the different items that arose:

- Steering Group responsibilities, chair and website updates
- Advisory Group setup, identifying communities/experiments
- Defining criteria for HSF Affiliate Projects, approaching key projects

N.B. Just to re-advertise that the Steering Group membership is open for people who would like to help. We already added one new member, viz. Nicole Skidmore.

Looks like next SG meeting will be on Monday - more news after that.

## Activities and HSF Group Updates

### PyHEP

[Timetable](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1384010/timetable/#20240701.detailed) is up - almost 400 people registered.

### Software Training

[HSF/IRIS-HEP Software Basics Training on 8-9 July](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1428522/)

HSF/IRIS-HEP Python for Analysis a week after (July 16)

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

An "advanced C++" course is planned Mo, We, Fr in the week of 30 Sep. - <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1430163/>


### JuliaHEP

- WG Meeting today <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1420509/>
- Accepted "Julia in HEP" contribution as plenary at CHEP24. Several other contributions have also been accepted.

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

September meeting will focus on a new roofline/profiling tool from researchers in Lisbon.

### Event generators

Graeme and Stefan discussed with some of the key generator people in LPCC and MCnet last week. LPCC are setting up a new working group with experiment, theory and computing representation. Stefan will sit on that with both a CERN IT and HSF hat. This group is LHC focused. We think the HSF Generator Group can fit nicely into this landscape, providing a community forum, e.g., a link to the neutrino community, nuclear physics, etc. Plus it is a good place to discuss technical issues like HepMC3 and so on.

Generator conveners and some SG members will meet soon to discuss the strategy further. One topic to discuss further is how to avoid problems from the split in funding streams for NP and HEP.

Conveners would like to accelerate the organisation of the GPU generators workshop - maybe even before the summer.

### Questionnaires

Given the upcoming questionnaire proliferation (ECFA computing WGs, EVERSE, ECFA-ECRs), Caterina volunteered (to ATLAS computing/EVERSE colleagues) to start a codimd (or git or?) to collect information on which groups is sending what. 

Could the HSF be a place to host this list and how should we do this? It will grow/get updated, hopefully by those sending the questionnaires as well.

Google doc, as easy as possible.
Wish to make results public (e.g. links to public presentations where results are discussed).

SPECTRUM and JENA WP2 are planning to unify their questionnaires (avoid survey fatigue!).

### School on ML on edge

Funded and organized by SMARTHEP ITN + Next Gen Trigger @ CERN: tasters for different kinds of hybrid computing architecture.  Advertisement to go out soon (priority to funded students, then will open to others --> will advertise on trigger&reco list).

### Website

Still looking for any help with re-structuring the website. Indicate your interest on this [GH Issue](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411).

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [4 July](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355751/).
