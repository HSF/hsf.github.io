### *Reminder* SPECTRUM/JENA Survey on Software, Computing, Training

> Dear Colleagues from Research / Infrastructures,
>
> The SPECTRUM project [1] and the JENA Computing Initiative [2] are conducting a survey to gather insights on current best practice and expected future evolutions in the domain of large scale / data intensive scientific computing.
>
> The survey is directed at researchers, managers of scientific initiatives and infrastructure managers, either on individual or institutional bases.
>
> Our goal is to collect from the community insights on current best practice and expected future evolutions in the domain of large scale / data intensive scientific computing. This is important also for you, if you want to inform policy makers and funders about the needs from science and infrastructures and push in the direction of future interoperability.

[Link to Survey](https://ec.europa.eu/eusurvey/runner/SPECTRUM-JENA_Survey1)

Please consider filling this in and also helping to disseminate it to your colleagues.

The survey is *differentiated* - filling in the Software and Training part (of most interest to HSF) should only take 10-15 minutes.

### Next HSF/WLCG Workshop

The next WLCG/HSF meeting will be hosted by IJCLab in Orsay next May 5-9 (thank you Michel!).

We will need people for the organising team - please say if you are interested.

Topics of mutual interest with WLCG are favoured, but there will also be HSF dedicated sessions.

### European Strategy Update

The [European Particle Physics Strategy Update](https://home.cern/news/news/knowledge-sharing/updating-european-strategy-particle-physics) will be next year:

- Inputs from the community by 31 March 2025
- Open Symposium 23-27 June 2025

We think it is a very good idea to have an input from the HSF on the software that we need for the future and how we achieve it.

This would be a mini-update of the CWP from 2007.

We believe that input coordinated by our **working groups** will be critical to doing this, especially from the critical areas of event generation, simulation, reconstruction and analysis; however, we should not at all forget the *people* dimension, so training and careers are vital to cover.

### LHCC

Eduardo circulated the link to the LHCC presentation via the [Architects' Forum meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1354965/).

The draft [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1361TObGpuKHpOLXwaubsBNdJBYPG5aV_32eYblKjpvI/edit?usp=sharing) are available.

### HSF Seminar Series

We need to progress on organising the Seminar Series for the Autumn. Likely we could have 3 meetings this year at the start of October, November and December? (for September it’s rather late now).

- Using the Computing & Accelerator forum slot (Wednesday 4:30-6:00 pm Geneva time) on other weeks
    - Proposal: last Wednesday of the month
- First seminar foreseen in October: 30th (may be in an holiday period)
    - Alternative: 16th (23rd is CHEP week)
    - Will get in touch soon with Software Triggers & Reco who proposed something around 4-D reconstruction

A few Steering Group members have offered to coordinate the organisation: Benedikt, Michel, Andrea(?)

Suggestions for topics are really needed!

## Steering Group News

There was a Steering Group meeting on 26 August and the [minutes](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/2024/08/26/steering.html) are available on the website.

- *Steering Group* is now the official name on the website (if you spot anachronistic references to the Coordination Team please make a PR)
- The HSF Affiliated Projects description has been lightly modified ([document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Un1V21LdehQNwkNGeUZOl_GBQ8IdjUpDp5bi9g2YvLg/edit?usp=sharing), [guidelines on levels](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AiLcqyLA4c1y2Iq-YZyKP7DwN8m2AJb_J44cDuGGAXI/edit))
    - This is now to be circulated to the Forum for feedback (and a call for early adopters)
- The HSF Advisory Group [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L62pleuuME6K9WLl5T4KQaImPP_Qpc8HSym-XBNTKv8/edit?usp=sharing) received a few points of feedback which will be dealt with
- We propose to remove the difference between WGs and other activities: everything will now be called activity.
    - Web site will be updated accordingly

## AOB

### Live Notes

Due to a change in CodiMD access policy (limited number of editors for the free access), we moved the live notes to [CERNBox](https://cernbox.cern.ch/s/vaE9Hbv9ZiuOJOn)

- Public link: every person who has it can edit
- No need to have a CERN account but if you have one, it is better if you log in

### Website

There is an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity. Please contact Mark and Graeme if you would like to help.

The link checker is fixed: <https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/pull/1574>!

### Next Meeting

Next meeting will be [12 September](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355756/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - we need volunteers from now until the end of the year!
