## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

The Indico for the WLCG-HSF workshop at DESY (13-17 May) is now available: <https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf-2024>.

Registration should open soon (which will happen via DESY Indico).

At the moment Graeme and Eduardo are "core" organisers (session conveners will be needed). Would anyone else like to join that core team?

- Caterina could help but needs to leave the workshop on May 16th

Ideas for sessions

- We have often had area focused sessions, e.g., simulation, reconstruction, etc.
- Or we go more topical, e.g., accelerators, language evolution
    - For topical sessions, maybe this is a chance to involve the collaboration computing coordinators more in the choice of sessions by asking "what is useful"?
- We could have a session on RSE career panel 
- Should try to link this to EVERSE somehow (kick-off for EVERSE is mid-March)

At the IRIS-HEP Steering Board meeting (see below), there was support for a session on *Analysis Facilities*.

### HSF Organisation and Structure

In the Coordination Team we started to think about how the HSF is organised and how to tackle the challenges for our second decade.

This is an ongoing, and productive, discussion - we should have ideas that we want to discuss more widely with everyone soon.

## Working Group Updates

### Conveners for 2024

We are in the process of inviting new conveners for 2024. We have had quite a few positive responses already:

- Jamie Gooding (Dortmund, LHCb) will join the Data Analysis WG
- Saptaparna Bhattacharya (Wayne State, CMS) will join the Physics Generators WG
- Nikolai Hartmann (Munich, ATLAS and Belle II) will join the PyHEP WG
- Jim Pivarski (Princeton, IRIS-HEP and CMS) will move to the Training WG

### Frameworks WG in 2024

- *We decided that the developments in Frameworks overlap rather a lot with other HSF activities, such as Development Tools, Reconstruction and the Compute Accelerator Forum. Therefore we stop it as an independent WG this year and cover relevant topics in the other fora.*

### Data Analysis

- Looking forward to meeting Jamie and making a plan for 2024. Curious about DESY workshop planning / possible steps towards that which would make sense (like preparatory meetings).

### Detector Simulation

- Held a meeting on "Next FLUKA generation and its tangible convergences with Geant4" <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1338814/>.
- There was Geant4 assessment of simulation R&D projects AdePT and Celeritas <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1332507/>. The report from that is expected soon.

### Software Training

- Hackathon Feb 12th:
    - Possible topics: Pipelines / Analysis Preservation / Training Center

- Analysis Preservation Training:
    - Docker-Singularity-CI/CD
    - 26th Feb - 1st Mar

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- 10th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training: The Essentials, Mar 25 -29

### PyHEP

- Organisation of PyHEP.dev 2024 developers workshop due to restart next week.
- That of PyHEP 2024 online user workshop will start concretely once the WG conveners team is set.
- Report on experience gathered over the years at the DESY workshop?

### JuliaHEP

- Graeme gave a talk on Julia at the Grid Deployment Board last week, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1356130/>.

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Registration for organizations opens 22.1. The HSF team will stay the same as last year (Baidyanath, Wouter, Valentin, Benedikt)
Focus this year should be more on AI related topics as asked for by Google. Biggest visible change is the introduction of a small project category. Which means we have small (~90 hours), medium (~175 hrs) and large (~350 hours) projects.

### Analysis Facilities

- The IRIS-HEP steering board organised a [meeting on Analysis Facilities](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1296090/), with presentations from ATLAS, CMS and HSF.
- The meeting was very positive and there was general agreement that we should have a session on this topic at the WLCG-HSF workshop in DESY.
- In parallel the Analysis Facilities Forum conveners are making a very concerted effort to finish the [AFF Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pn9KWG-tGQ20OaNFUVlXLQddC7vFsQnu2EHR4DBfTjo/edit?usp=sharing), hoping to circulate a second draft in the next few weeks (but if you want to help at this stage, also feel free to take a look).

Really need to pin down needs and use cases to have a productive discussion at DESY - this will need some experiment commitment and input.

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

- Stefan gave a talk on CAF at the Grid Deployment Board last week, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1356130/>.

- We held the first meeting of 2024 [last week](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329685/), with a talk on *Three garbage collectors: Java, Python, and Julia* from Jim Pivarski
    - Well attended, interesting and the video is uploaded
- Meeting on *HEPiX Benchmarking* is [scheduled for 14 February](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329686/)
- We are planning and actively inviting speakers for the rest of 2024
    - Please send ideas for talks to [compute-accelerator-forum-organizers@cern.ch](mailto:compute-accelerator-forum-organizers@cern.ch).

## AOB

### Website

There is an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.

*We aim to try and have a new website ready for the workshop.*

### Community Calendar

Should be complete now for 2024, but please also add anything else relevant for the software and computing communities in NHEP that you see is missing.

### JENA Computing Workshop

After the [JENA Computing Workshop](https://agenda.infn.it/event/34738) in June, there is now a call for people to participate in the 5 key area working groups (HPC, Software, DOMA, Machine Learning, Training).

See [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ovq71s8ytSQc5iRWNs7HPyjNhewBVSj/view), for the workshop summary and links to express interest in the WGs.

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [1 February](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355740/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing one of the 2024 meetings.
