### European Strategy Update (ESPPU)

Discussion on HSF inputs.

See [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355758/contributions/5708314/attachments/2945044/5175250/HSF%20Inputs%20from%20European%20Strategy%20Update.pdf) attached to the agenda.

As said in previous meetings, HSF input to ESPPU is important
* Input to last ESPPU was based on CWP: good time for CWP update
* To reflect the community view, the key actors must be the HSF activities (and thus the activity coordinators!)
* Deadline is tight: end of March 2025. Must start immediately our work to prepare the document that we'll submit. Timeline proposal:
    * Now -> beginning of January: activity meetings to get the community feedback on the topic identified
    * January : writing of chapter drafts
    * Feb 1-15: assembling of chapters, first paper draft
    * Feb 15 - March 1 : draft circulation and finalization
    * March: community endorsement (something like what we did for the CWP, asking for people to sign it)

- Claire - meetings organised by activity areas?
    - Yes, we have to delegate this down to the activity area coordinators
- Tommaso - are these meetings in addition to the seminar series?
    - Yes, the work required doesn't fill well into the seminars
- Alex, yes the training WG can contribute
- Eduardo, this would be a much shorter paper
- Michel, not starting from zero, we have a lot of experience already and can do this on a much shorter timescale (original CWP was ~18 months)
- Patrick - will try to schedule a mini-workshop to see where we are with the development tools and prepare input to the document
    - Graeme: great idea, probably focus on-line, 1/2 day, meetings
- We shall do "checkpoints" with the groups in these coordination meetings (don't need extra ones!)
- Experiments are preparing their inputs, do we take these into account?
    - Ideally yes, as people are in the experiments we hope this is not a problem
- Stephen M. (generators): ok with the proposal

Action: Michel/Graeme will contact the relevant activities with the plan and ask them to get started

Length?

- 1 page too short
- 10 pages too much
- Probably the target is 3-5 pages per activity

Mainly software matters, but sociological risks should all be covered.

### HSF Seminar Series

The seminar series is up and running:

- [Julia in high-energy physics: a paradigm shift or just another tool?](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1452314/), Uwe Acosta
- [Julia as a Statically-Compiled Language](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1462252/), Jeff Bezanson

We would now like to advance the planning for the next events. Scheduled dates would be:

- 30 October (it's quite soon...)
- 27 November: Generators?
  - Stephen M. checks with the people involved
- 29 January
- 26 February

Please coordinate with Michel and Benedikt!

## Steering Group News

### Advisory Group

The [Advisory Group mandate](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/advisory-group.html) is published. Invitations have been sent to the large HEP experiments, WLCG and the theory community (MCnet).

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

The description of [HSF Affiliated Projects and Software](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/projects/affiliated.html) is now on the website. It motivates the activity and sets out some of the parameters for things like reviews, defining requirements and providing reference implementations.

The actual [guidelines for projects](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/projects/guidelines.html) are on a separate page.

- Do people know of projects (theirs or others) who would like to trial the process of becoming an affiliate?

## Activity Updates

### Software Tools and Packaging

Conveners met last week Friday. Discussed putting together a mini-workshop to review the build tools used by the CERN and Fermilab experiments.

### Detector Simulation

Geant4 Collaboration meeting is ongoing this week in Catania; an open session dedicated to user presentations took place today

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Will probably be able to finalise seminar speakers on 4D tracking for a January or February HSF seminar slot.

### PyHEP

The report of the PyHEP.dev 2024 workshop (Aachen, 26 Aug - 30 Aug) is [published on the ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02112). It is a community-driven document, as nearly all participants contributed to the paper.

### Physics Generators

*GPUs and Generators*, will try to arrange something for the HSF Seminar series.

### JuliaHEP

We had the [JuliaHEP 2024 Workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/juliahep2024) last week.

- Big success, about 40 people attended in-person and up to 30 more on Zoom
    - Excellent atmosphere and positive spirit
- Had three keynotes, the two HSF Seminars (see above) and a talk from Tim Besard from JuliaHub on [Introduction to GPU Programming (in Julia)](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1410341/contributions/6148708/) (which is also posted to YouTube)
- Overall about 20 talks from HEP, astroparticle and industry (ASML)
- Hackathon sessions involved a lot of discussions on Lorentz vectors and particle interfaces, as well as ROOT building/bindings and possible training material
- Discussion of the most important next topics for [JuliaHEP](https://notes.desy.de/rp4Rg15ySZqlhCEzFGrK2Q?view) was had at the end of the workshop

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

- Meeting yesterday (9 October) on [RISC-V extended precision accelerators](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329694/) from CEA colleagues Eric Guthmuller and Jérôme Fereyre
    - Slides and video are available
- Next meeting 13 November, [Heterogeneous Accelerated Compute Cluster](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329695/) by Gustavo Alonso (ETHZ)
