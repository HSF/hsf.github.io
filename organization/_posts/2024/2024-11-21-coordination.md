## News, general matters, announcements

### LHCC

- Eduardo’s presentation (Tuesday 19th) on behalf of the HSF and various projects was well received.
  - It was appreciated that the proposals made earlier in the year are now put into practice.
  - Interest in seeing more projects/libraries as affiliated.

### European Strategy Update (ESPPU)

Things are in motion!

Activity area mini-workshops are being organised:

- **Detector Simulation** Community input on the European Strategy for Particle Physics Update, Friday 22 November, 15h-18h CET, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1475445/> (at CERN meeting in room 2/R-030)
- **Reconstruction and Software Triggers** Mini workshop: Input for European Strategy for Particle Physics 2025, Wednesday 27 November, 14-16h CET, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1475492/>

Data Analysis and Physics Generators should announce their dates soon.
* Data Analysis: Dec. 16 foreseen... To be confirmed.

Generators had a discussion with key people last week about the challenges that need covered in the EPPSU submission.
A draft of the main points is in preparation now. Main points of discussion were:
 - Summarize what happened since the last white paper (<https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.14938>)
 - Limit to 10 pages: 2 page update for generators
    - Possible breakdown of material:
        - Running experiments: 1 page on HL-LHC, heavy ions
        - Future experiments: 1 page on DUNE, FCC-ee, EIC
- Highlight
    - Successes
    - What we need for the ensuring continued success in the future
    - Person power — supporting generator theory community and promoting physicists with software development skills
- Timeline:
    - Before Christmas: meet once again and agree on basic content
    - January: write, send for comments
    - February: comments and finalize by March
    - Provide updates at every HSF coordination meeting

Stefan: there was a kick-off of the LHCC MC WG last week. The WG would like to stay aligned with HSF's inputs.

Steven: there will be a submission on neutrino scattering, which will also have aspects of the neutrino generators.
Steven will take care of harmonising this with the other document.

- **Training and careers**. Last month we had the HSF Training Pre-CHEP Worshop where we had the opportunity
to exchange and gather ideas from different collaborations, projects and efforts on training,
in particular from ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, DUNE, EIC, ErUM-Data-Hub, Everse, HSF-India and ICFA.
We are starting the draft of the contribution including the current status, challenges and recommendations.
We'll discuss about this in detail in our regular meetings every week.

It's important to cover the *careers* aspect as well. Here we can work with StefanRoiser and the JENA WP5 group.

In discussions with the experiments about them endorsing the final document - ALICE and LHCb are favourable.

### HSF Seminar Series

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).

Next scheduled seminar dates are:

- 27 November: Event Generation on GPUs
- 29 January:
- 26 February: 4D reconstruction
- 26 March: EPPSU

Nicole Skidmore has agreed to join the seminar team, together with Michel and Benedikt.

## Steering Group News

We had a Steering Group meeting on Tuesday 19 November - [minutes](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/2024/11/19/steering.html) are available.

### Advisory Group

The HEP experiments (ALICE, ATLAS, Belle II, DUNE, CMS, LHCb), WLCG and the theory community (MCnet) were contacted and all responded positively to being on the AG.

Intention is to have a first AG meeting early next year.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

First review, [prmon](https://github.com/HSF/prmon), is done. This is the first new affiliated project for the HSF!

N.B. official links to the [HSF Project Badges](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/projects/badges.html) are now available.

*We need to find people to help do these reviews.* They are fairly lightweight and should not take a lot of time - we are checking usefulness and impact in the community, as well as software development and project best practices.

The [NNPDF collaboration](https://github.com/NNPDF) asked more than a month ago to be included - discussions with generator conveners to find an additional reviewer.

We should also start to approach our previous projects. Volunteers?

Michel: are we refining the process and aims of the review? We are learning from the process and we will refine things, including feedback from the projects.

Todo: add on the HSF site a page with the list of affiliated projects.

Claire: OSPO workshop, there was a question on how the OSPO can help project visibility. However, the OSPO is for CERN projects - but there might be a useful discussion to be had with them.

## Activity Updates

It is time to consider again conveners for 2025 - will people be happy to stay on or feel it is time to standdown? Thanks to those who already indicated their intentions.

For others please let us know at hsf-search-committee@cern.ch (currently Benedikt, Claire, Michel, Liz, Graeme, and **Paul**).

### Data Analysis

- Aiming to host meeting to discuss ESPPU inputs tentatively on Dec 16, still confirming this date before sending out emails.
The next weeks are quite packed already with many workshops, so this looks to be the best choice.


### Software Training

We are planning activities for next year:

- Software Basics Training at CERN. Hybrid. June.
- Train-the-Trainers Workshop, with ErUM-Data-Hub in September.


### Software Tools and Packaging

- Spack has a new release: 0.23. The next release will be 1.0!

### Detector Simulation

- See above for the info on the European Strategy Update meeting on November 22nd.
- Noted that Apprentice and Open|SpeedShop are no longer funded (the latter's .org website is no longer there).

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Our ESSPU mini workshop [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1475492/) is finalised.
- Have also shared a Google doc (linked in agenda) for people to provide input before/during/after meeting.
- Worry that may not have reached enough CMS people?
    - In particular, are key people expected to be attending the conflicting NextGen Triggers workshop? (Got complaints from ATLAS side.)
    - If people cannot make these workshop meetings they can give input on the documents (there are no good times to have meetings, only less bad ones...)
    - Also plan to record the mini-workshop so that people can watch in their own time and then add comments


### PyHEP

- Will submit soon the workshop report to the Python Software Foundation to feedback, as they helped fund workshops.

### Physics Generators

See the EPPSU discussion above.

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

- 12 Feb 2025: [Verrou floating point stability checker](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1472679/)
(Valgrid based tool developed in EDF/France.)

## AOB

### Next Meeting

Next meeting will be [5 December](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355762/).

### HSF Talks

Graeme gave an HSF talk at DESY last week: [slides on Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14186952), *HEP Software Foundation: Past, Present and Future*.

If you want the "source" just ask!

### 2025 Meetings

[Coordination meeting slots](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7970/) have been booked for 2025 - the usual pattern every two weeks on *odd* weeks of the year. The first meeting next year will be on 16 January 2025.

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - including 2025!
