### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

**Reminder**

Registration is now open for the WLCG-HSF workshop at DESY (13-17 May): <https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf-2024> (register at the DESY linked Indico).

Graeme, Eduardo and Caterina are helping with the overall organisation for HSF.

We have a few dedicated sessions/talks:

- Analysis Facilities (N.B. the whitepaper is now finalised), discussing with the experiments
- HSF Evolution Plans
- HSF Training Activities

Our main HSF activity will, however, refocus on community software. We have opened a [call for abstracts](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/abstracts/):

> The HSF will have several sessions on Community Software at the workshop.
> We invite you to submit abstracts for talks of 20' where you can describe a tool, package or other contribution that you are making to software for multiple HEP experiments.
> Submissions describing projects or other ideas, such as training initiatives or community support structures are also warmly welcomed.
> This is your chance to show off how good your project is and to meet and talk to current and future users!

**Please broadcast this call widely and encourage contributors.** Deadline is 18 March.

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Student vetting period coming to an end. Selected students can start to work on proposals.

### HSF Evolution

Work in progress: we will present more updates in 2 weeks.

## Working Group Updates

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Analysis Facilities

The Analysis Facilities Forum [Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pn9KWG-tGQ20OaNFUVlXLQddC7vFsQnu2EHR4DBfTjo/edit?usp=sharing) is now revised and finalised.

*In the best HSF tradition, you are invited to read and endorse the paper (please [email the AFF conveners](mailto:hsf-af-forum-convenors@googlegroups.com) to do this)*.

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

Indico agenda for March/Apr/May: <https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/>.

March: *joint meeting with OpenLab (Nvidia)* (Probably cancelled)
April: high-performance I/O for HEP
May: GPU infrastructure and tools being developed; CERN infrastructure update

Planned to have AMD later this year (June?) with CPU/GPU updates; and an update from Nvidia.

### Software and Computing Roundtable

Restart pushed back to April.

## AOB

### EVERSE Kickoff Meeting

The [EVERSE](https://everse.software/) consortium (research software and code excellence!) had its kick-off meeting this week.
A report from Graeme, Caterina and Stefan will be given in the next meeting.

### CERN Mail filtering

We had issues again this week with HSF mail being quarantined by the CERN mail filters (xorlabs). This was due to Google Group's propensity to spoof sender addresses (see [this article](https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing). HSF Forum, WG Convener and Coordination lists are now whitelisted.

We hoped that changing the `Default sender` to `Group Address` would help, but it doesn't (changes `Sender:`, but not `From:`).

If you have other Google Groups you use, please watch out for this!

### Other workshops

- [FAIROS-HEP Workshop on workflow languages for HEP analysis](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1380367/) (3-5 April, 2024).

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [28 March](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355744/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing one of the 2024 meetings.
