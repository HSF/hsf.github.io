## News, general matters, announcements

### European Strategy Update (ESPPU)

We have had four of the meetings to gather inputs with the community:

- Detector simulation
- Reconstruction and Software Triggers
- Training and Careers
- Generators (met on Nov 15th)

Data Analysis group meeting will be [Dec. 16](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1486671/), announcement to follow shortly.

*Should we make a specific call for further inputs now? Contact conveners?*

- Yes.

Contact made with all the LHC experiments plus DUNE and Belle II. Generally they seem well disposed to signing the document.

#### Preparing the Draft

Schedule is to have a draft ready in January. Because of the extra time needed by the experiments to endorse, we would like to target 17 January for this to be ready.

Suggestion: as we expect a lot of activity in terms of comments we begin this as a Google Doc. (The intention would be to finalise as LaTeX.)

- Agreed on both points.

### HSF Seminar Series and Compute Accelerator Forum

[Seminar Indico Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/18810/).
[Compute & Accelerator Forum Category](https://indico.cern.ch/category/12741/)

Third HSF seminar took place last week: Event Generation on GPUs

Next scheduled seminar dates are:
     
- 29 January: no topic identified yet, any volunteer?
    - Sapta: Future colliders (including Key4Hep, 1 detector)
- 19 February: Verrou, floating point stability check
- 26 February: 4D reconstruction
- 26 March: EPPSU

Other experiments? Einstein telescope / GW Low Latency analysis ? Can discuss with Paul.

We are discussing how to optimise organisation of the events - concrete proposal to follo after an SG discussion.

### Advisory Group

Date of the first AG meeting is not yet set. Graeme will send around a Newdle before the end of the year (target end of January). Setting up mailing list now.

### HSF Affiliated Projects and Software

*We need to find people to help do these reviews.* They are fairly lightweight and should not take a lot of time - we are checking usefulness and impact in the community, as well as software development and project best practices.

The [NNPDF collaboration](https://github.com/NNPDF) asked more than a month ago to be included - discussions with generator conveners to find an additional reviewer.

We should also start to approach our previous projects. Volunteers?

Todo: add on the HSF site a page with the list of affiliated projects.

## Activity Updates

Thanks for people who have made their intentions clear, either to stay on or step down.

We anticipate calls for new conveners in most groups: Data Analysis, Simulation, PyHEP, Reco and SW Triggers, Dev Tools and Packaging, Training, Physics Generators. JuliaHEP is TBD.

**We are now seeking nominations for these groups.** Please contact [hsf-search-committee@cern.ch](mailto:hsf-search-committee@cern.ch) (currently Benedikt, Claire, Michel, Liz, Graeme, and Paul).

### Data Analysis

Announcement for Dec 16 ESPPU to follow shortly: [agenda](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1486671/)

### Software Training

We are planning activities for next year, including training events and hackathons, and we hope to have a complete plan by the end of the year-beginning of January 

HSF/IRIS-HEP Software Basics Training - June 18-20, 2025, at CERN

A date for the [12th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training - The Essentials](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477096/) has been set for the week 10-14 March.
    
### Software Tools and Packaging

Nothing to report.

### Detector Simulation

- Sent a reminder to provide ESSPU input in addition to the one provided at the November 22nd meeting;
    - Next step would be to start drafting the main points and the text
- Geant4 Technical Forum to be held on [December 12th](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1482839/)

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

[Mini workshop on ESPPU input](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1475492/)
- Had *excellent* speakers giving *excellent* talks.
    - Recording available - see agenda (glad we recorded it in the end!)
- Attendance was ~35 people(?) (varied as long 3-hour session). Roughly 50/50 split between ATLAS & LHCb with ~1-2 from CMS, ALICE, ePIC (but key people, e.g. computing coordinators amongst them).
    - No one from DUNE & Belle II (we believe?). 
- Tried to summarise the main messages and discussion points, [see here!](https://cernbox.cern.ch/external/public/BcwnnBuIKBeQ4rt/HSF_TriggerReco_ESPPU2025.md)
- Also advertised beforehand and during meeting [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNhQ-IjPAmL2-Mx2tXtDAloPLWFprIt9mToa11iQb9M/edit?tab=t.0) for community input, in particular as not much time for discussion. But doc mostly only used by us (convenors).
- Quick thoughts on some topics that may have not been covered:
    - Offline computing: In particular challenges of hetereogenous computing technologies? Main focus was all around trigger, with exception of 4D reco.
    - Energy sustainability: Natural common thread throughout _all_ topics though - is this something we can address generally in the HSF document?
        - No problem to add a paragraph on this that may be moved in a common section
        - Graeme: wider issue of environmental sustainability, it's not just CO2


### PyHEP

The report to the PSF concerning the sponsorship for the PyHEP 2024 workshop was submitted last week.

### Physics Generators

Work done related to ESPPU

### JuliaHEP

We are starting to plan the JuliaHEP 2025 workshop.

### Next Meeting

Next meeting will be [16 January](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1477045/)

- Meeting planned on December 19 is cancelled
- ESSPU work progress will be followed up by email


### 2025 Meetings

[Coordination meeting slots](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7970/) have been booked for 2025 - the usual pattern every two weeks on *odd* weeks of the year. The first meeting next year will be on 16 January 2025.

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing this or one of the future coordination meetings - including 2025!
