## Tips

- If you find you cannot edit these notes please login with your GitHub account!

- If you are adding a URL, please use `<` and `>` to make it an active link, as in `<https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#autolink>`
    - Without the <>s the link is not active in Jekyll, even if it is in CodiMD
- Please use `-` to indicate lists in this file (we try to avoid mixing `-` and `*` in the same file - it's markdown lint!)
- Please use the Zoom "raise hand" if you'd like to make a comment in the meeting

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG and HSF Evolution

(Impressions from Graeme - please feel free to add your own)

Overall we felt this was a successful workshop - ~40 people in the room for the software sessions, plus 10-20 on Zoom. A lot of interesting talks and good discussions.

The opening plenary talk on [HSF retrospective and future](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/contributions/5908531/) seemed well received.

The session on [HSF Evolution](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/sessions/536732/#20240514) went pretty well - generally comments were constructive (even when partially critical). See [live notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pJVWsZfTmV-JcmOSrwtstt2jZpIw1L_CjXjU8NTngDI/edit?usp=sharing) for a summary of the discussion.

[Training session](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/sessions/536735/#20240515) had lots of great talks and a good spirit of collaboration. *One of our most appreciated activities!*

For discussion of follow-ups see the [closing slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/contributions/5908515/) that Eduardo presented.

Main points:

- Should we have a more formalised time for comments on the proposals?
    - Practically Google Doc comments or by email?
- ~~Coordination Team~~ Steering Group
    - General happiness with the plan...?
    - Rename the Coordination Team to the Steering Group
        - Concretely we can rename hsf-core-coordination to hsf-steering
        - Elect an SG chair
    - Let's repeat here the call for new coordinators!
- Setup the Advisory Group
    - We need to act on who to invite here (experiments plus WLCG at least?)
- Reorganising "Working Groups" and "Activities"
    - Setting up the seminar series seems to get broad support
        - Would help a lot to focus community interest on highlight topics
        - 1x month?
            - How does this play with C&AF and Roundtable?
            - Not clear yet, does need to be re-discussed in the broader context
        - Do not want to "disband" the WGs, we need their expertise
    - In which areas do we really have "working" and which are more like "forums"
        - e.g., the Training WG really work!
            - But what's the best nomenclature?
        - We need input from the WG experts to help organise the seminars
- HSF Affiliated Projects
    - Some interest
    - Would need to **define the criteria** (and do some practical things to generate badges)
    - We need to make some approaches to projects that we think are key to have in this process
    - Project awards (maybe move on this later...?)


## Working Group Updates

### General Standing Reminders

#### Website banners

We have the ability to put event banners on the HSF website. All it requires is a markdown file with the event data. See, e.g., files [here](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/tree/main/announcements/_posts/2023).

#### Meetings

Please try and book meetings in Indico at least 2 weeks in advance!

That way they go into the calendar early and they will be included in the weekly email announcement that goes to HSF Forum.

### Event generators

Graeme and Leif will have a chat with Michelangelo to try and understand the evolving efforts here, supported by the LPCC.

Steve: trying to ressurect "apprentice" as a successor to "professor"; good to see that HDF5 version of LHE files is more prominent (LHEH5, see [talk by Chris](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/contributions/5883607/) at the workshop).

## AOB

### ICFA Panel

There was a meeting this week of the new ICFA Panel on Data Lifecycles

- Two [presentations](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1411166/) on training, for HSF/IRIS-HEP (Graeme) and EVERSE (Stefan)

### Website

Graeme had a play with converting the website to run with Hugo or to update the Jekyll theme (currently the very basic `minima`)

- Automatic conversion was not a great success - it really just moves the "posts" into the Hugo `content` folder
- Yes, it's completely possible to do this, but I think it's a week's work to get everything looking good
    - Volunteers...? Anyone have a student who is good with websites?

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [6 June](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355749/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing one of the 2024 meetings.

**We now have a [guide](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/running-meetings.html) for running the meeting!**
