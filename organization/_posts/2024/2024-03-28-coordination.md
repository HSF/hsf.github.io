## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

The extended abstract submission deadline passed on Monday. In the end we had almost too many abstracts to fit in.

We decided, with the training group, to have 6 sessions dedicated to community software (+1) and 1 for training (-1). Together with a few merges this allowed us to squeeze in all that we wanted. 

We have organising the abstracts into appropriate session blocks:

- Community Software and Software Projects
- Generators
- File Formats and Performance
- Fitting and Reinterpretation
- Accelerated Computing

**Early registration for the workshop is now extended to 8 April - please sign up!**

Training: there will be a 90' session, invited talks and discussion time on increasing the impact of training. Wed 15 May, PM.

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Selected students are working on proposals - note that the deadline for proposals is very soon now, 2 April 18 UTC.

### HSF Evolution

We now have decent drafts of some of our HSF evolution documents. Some of the highlight points are:

- A stronger, better defined role for the *Core Coordination Group*
- A new *Advisory Group*, where we formally gather experiment feedback
- New ideas on what an *HSF Project* means: this can include *HSF Reference Implementations* and some badge for acknowledging a project's work
    - There will be minimum guidelines on software quality
- A role the HSF could play as a *Virtual Centre of Excellence for Scientific Software*
    - This would be alongside other, funded, activities

### EVERSE Kickoff Meeting

The [EVERSE](https://everse.software/) consortium (research software and code excellence!) had its kick-off meeting two weeks ago. There is a [news article](https://everse.software/news/2024-03-11-kickoff/) on the website.

### CERN Mail filtering

Not much of an update in the last two weeks. Mail forwarding continues to be an issue and the whole landscape of email is changing towards strict SPF/DKIM/DMARC.

We are getting HSF lists whitelisted (HSF Forum, WG Convener and Coordination lists are now ok). If you see other problems, please send a ticket to CERN Security.

### Other workshops

- [FAIROS-HEP Workshop on workflow languages for HEP analysis](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1380367/) (3-5 April, 2024)

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [11 April](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355745/).
