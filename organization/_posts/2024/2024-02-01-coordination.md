## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

[WCLG-HSF workshop at DESY](https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf-2024) (13-17 May) (it will go back public very soon!)

Registration should open at the end of this week (which will happen via DESY Indico).

Graeme, Eduardo and Caterina are helping with the overall organisation for HSF.

Our ideas so far:

- Presentations on Open Science from [EVERSE](https://everse.software)/[ESCAPE](https://projectescape.eu)/[OSCARS](https://oscars-project.eu)
- Analysis Facilities, also with WLCG
- Community Software Tools
    - We have some specific ideas (e.g., CondDB, Phoenix, Key4hep), but we also want to have an *open call* for contributions
- WG Activities
    - What to people think? We up-front had the idea that we could have session on training, as it is such a transversal topic
    - Please let us know ASAP on this, at the latest by the end of February
- Software Citation workshop follow-up?
    - Use this as an opportunity to wrap this one up!
    - And discuss any follow-up actions (e.g., global BiBTeX)
- Plus it is the HSF's 10th birthday, we look at the history and discuss the future

### LHCC in February

Slide(s) presented in [today's AF](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1354953/) and attached to this agenda from Eduardo.

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Registration for organizations opened. The HSF team will stay the same as last year (Baidyanath, Wouter, Valentin, Benedikt).

Focus this year should be more on AI related topics as asked for by Google. Biggest visible change is the introduction of a small project category. Which means we have small (~90 hours), medium (~175 hrs) and large (~350 hours) projects. Deadline for project proposals is *next week Feb 7* !

## Working Group Updates

There is an [issue in GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/issues/1411) to gather ideas about reorganising and revamping the website to better reflect our areas of actual activity.
