### Steering Group Organisation

- The new [Steering Group Mandate](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/team.html) is now published on the website

### Steering Group Roles

The following roles have been taken on by SG members so far:

| Role | SG Member(s) |
|------|--------------|
| SG Chair | Graeme |
| Data Analysis Liaison | Eduardo, Mark |
| Detector Simulation Liaison | Torre |
| Physics Generator Liaison | Liz, Stefan |
| JuliaHEP Liaison | Pere |
| PyHEP Liaison | Eduardo |
| Reconstruction and Software Triggers Liaison | Michel, Paul |
| Tools and Packaging Liaison | Liz |
| Training Liaison | Graeme, Nicole |
| Website Reorganisation | Graeme, Mark |
|------|--------------|

ACTION: SG Liaisons should arrange a discussion with their respective activity
area to discuss plans for the future. 

- In particular, do they envisage "working
group" actions (meaning doing some development with concrete outcomes) and/or
communication roles, e.g., contributing to the upcoming HSF seminar series.
- Ideas/contributions for the seminar series

### HSF Advisory Group

We decided the Advisory Group should be composed of HEP experiments, WLCG and
representatives from the generator/theory community.

### Affiliate Projects

ACTION: Eduardo and Pere to refine better the notion of metrics for different
levels of project support from the HSF (bronze, silver, gold)

Graeme worked on using [shields.io](https://shields.io/docs/logos) to produce badges that can be used on
GitHub/GitLab. See the new
[README](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/blob/main/images/HSF-logo/README.md)
on the website, where new SVG versions of the HSF logo also exist.

### Seminar Series

Decided to hold the seminar series in the same timeslot as the current [Compute
and Accelerator
Forum](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/meetings/compute-accelerator-forum.html),
viz. 16h30 CEST on Wednesdays.

At the moment we keep the C&AF and the HSF Seminars separate identities.

Some interest in also using this slot for a renewed [Software and Computing
Roundtable](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/meetings/roundtable.html), TBD.

Organising the seminar series will become a standing item in the HSF
Coordination Meetings.

## AOB

The next SG meeting will be on Monday 15 July at 15h CEST.
