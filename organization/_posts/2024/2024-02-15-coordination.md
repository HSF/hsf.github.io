## News, general matters, announcements

### HSF Joint Workshop with WLCG

Registration is now open for the WCLG-HSF workshop at DESY (13-17 May) is now available: <https://indico.cern.ch/e/wlcg-hsf-2024> (register at the DESY linked Indico)

Graeme, Eduardo and Caterina are helping with the overall organisation for HSF.

We would like to have a few dedicated sessions/talks:

- Analysis Facilities (N.B. the whitepaper is now finalised), discussing with the experiments
- Software Citation and Recognition Follow-up
- HSF Evolution Plans

Our main HSF activity will, however, refocus on community software. We have opened a [call for abstracts](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1369601/abstracts/):

> The HSF will have several sessions on Community Software at the workshop.
We invite you to submit abstracts for talks of 20' where you can describe a tool, package or other contribution that you are making to software for multiple HEP experiments.
Submissions describing projects or other ideas, such as training initiatives or community support structures are also warmly welcomed.
This is your chance to show off how good your project is and to meet and talk to current and future users!

**Please broadcast this call widely and encourage contributors.** Deadline is 18 March.

If any WG wants to organise a focus session, let us know ASAP (next week)! Block timetable (also for WLCG) will appear soon.

### LHCC in February and RRB Report

This is next week, Eduardo prepared a slide for PyHEP.dev ([attached](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355740/) to the last meeting).

Eduardo has also [drafted the HSF section of the RRB report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eWVDwO63LWLFeIIqHnY829BY2O6vX-_qYCEEoEQzuCk/edit?usp=sharing). Please contribute and comment by Monday 19 February.

(RRB -> Resource Review Board; review experiment resource requests, but the board now also takes an interest in software and staffing levels)

### Google Summer of Code 2024

Deadline for project proposals passed. We got in total 22 proposals and are now waiting for Google to announce the participating organizations and their quotas.

### HSF Evolution

The HSF Core Coordination Team has met a few times since the beginning of the year, thinking about how we (re)organise the HSF to be as effective as possible in our next decade.

We have now decided to work on specific proposals along the following lines:

- Have a formal mandate for the Core Coordination Team, regular meetings (x4 year) to discuss HSF directions and strategy
    - We will likely elect a chair for the Coordination Team to organise this
- Setup an HSF Advisory Group, experiments, projects, etc. who can give us feedback on activity and directions
- Reinvigorate HSF and Software Projects and Activities
    - Re-examine what this could look like for giving recognition to community driven solutions (without the project ceding any control to the HSF)
- Consider the role that HSF could play in a virtual centre of excellence for scientific software, along with other bodies
- Revamp the website

We should have more news soon on developing these ideas.

## Working Group Updates

### General Standing Reminders

### Conveners for 2024

The convener teams for 2024 are now complete!

New full list of conveners who are joining is:

- Jamie Gooding (Dortmund, LHCb) will join the Data Analysis WG

- Saptaparna Bhattacharya (Wayne State, CMS) will join the Physics Generators WG

- Nikolai Hartmann (Munich, ATLAS and Belle II) will join the PyHEP WG

- Jim Pivarski (Princeton, IRIS-HEP and CMS) joins the Training WG
- Valeriia Lukashenko (Zurich, CMS) joins the Training WG
- Holly Szumila-Vance (JLab, EIC) joins the Training WG

- Reiner Hauser (Michigan State, ATLAS) joins the Tools and Packaging WG
- Andrea Valenzuela (CERN, CMS) joins the Tools and Packaging WG
- Nathan Brei (JLab, EIC) moves to the Tools and Packaging WG

- Steve Mrenna (Fermilab) joins the Generators WG

- Joe Osborn (BNL, sPHENIX and ePIC) joins the Reconstruction and Software Trigger WG

- Kolja Kauder (BNL, EIC/STAR) joins the Simulation WG
- Tommaso Lari (INFN Milan, ATLAS) joins the Simulation WG

Many thanks to them, to our continuing conveners and to our outgoing colleagues üëè.

We have a good diversity in regions (thought AP is still weak), experiments and nuclear/HEP.

### Data Analysis

See [slides](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355741/contributions/5708297/attachments/2801733/4888103/HSF%20DAWG%202024%20plans.pdf) on indico.

Re. analysis facilities, LHCC had expressed some concerns about the differences in assumptions and had asked the experiments about their requirements. This is still being followed-up.

Work with Tools WG on optimisation would be a common area of interest - show people how to better use the profiling tools which are available.

Work on statistics, linking theory to *practical tools* would be another idea for activity that could work for DAWG.

LHC Reinterpretation Forum has people who could be interested in DAWG work, if the right connections can be made.

### Detector Simulation

- Geant4 Technical Forum today: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1366947/timetable/#20240215.detailed>

### Software Training

[Plans for 2024](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355741/contributions/5708297/attachments/2801733/4888097/Training-WG_status_and_plans_2024.pdf) are on Indico.

Name of Analysis Pipelines might be confusing (or at least unexpected).

Paying people to teach is logistically very complicated.

#### C++ Course and Hands-on Training

- 10th HEP C++ Course and Hands-on Training - The Essentials, Mar 25 -29 <https://indico.cern.ch/event/1370681/>
    - Registration now open

## *Postponed contributions*

Due to time constrains the following points were not discussed and postponed to the next meeting

### Reconstruction and Software Trigger

- Had first WG convener chat this week, gave Joe and overview of our activities last year.
- Following up on open threads from last year, starting with 4D tracking @ Belle II
- Happy to give WG report on 2024 plans in 2 week's time.

### PyHEP

### JuliaHEP

- Finalizing agenda for the next week's working group [meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1352938/).

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Analysis Facilities

The Analysis Facilities Forum [Whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pn9KWG-tGQ20OaNFUVlXLQddC7vFsQnu2EHR4DBfTjo/edit?usp=sharing) is now revised and finalised. An email will be circulated soon to advertise the report and to ask for endorsements.

*Huge thanks to the AFF team (Alessandra, Nicole, Lukas and Diego) for all the work they put into the AFF over the last two years!*

### Compute and Accelerator Forum

- Meeting on *HEPiX Benchmarking* [happened yesterday](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329686/)
- Next meeting should be on [27 March](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329687/) focussing on vendor roadmaps (updates from Intel and Nvidia expected)
    - N.B. Shifted slot to happen with the openlab Technical Forum, 26-27 March
- Meeting on [10 April](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1329688/) will look at High Performance IO for HEP

We are planning and actively inviting speakers for the rest of 2024 - there are still slots left!

- Please send ideas/offers for talks to [compute-accelerator-forum-organizers@cern.ch](mailto:compute-accelerator-forum-organizers@cern.ch).

### Software and Computing Roundtable

Plans to restart in March.

### CERN Mail filtering

We had issues again this week with HSF mail being quarantined by the CERN mail filters (xorlabs). This was due to Google Group's propensity to spoof sender addresses (see [this article](https://material.security/blog/identify-google-groups-vulnerable-to-spam-and-spoofing). HSF Forum, WG Convener and Coordination lists are now whitelisted. We are discussing if we can fix this also on the group settings, changing the `Default sender` to `Group Address`.

If you have other Google Groups you use, please watch out for this!

### Next Meetings

The next meeting will be on [29 February](https://indico.cern.ch/event/1355742/).

Reminder: please [sign up](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Z1Z4payCpieOLiVFcC6y9j-KCj71u6xX232LHUgIHfI/edit) for chairing one of the 2024 meetings.
