## News, general matters
  - [<span class="underline">LHCC WLCG
    Meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/754731/):
      - Graeme presented slides from software projects and HSF.
      - Question asked about Geant vectorisation R&D:
          - Emphasised again the intent to deliver improvements into
            production Geant4.
      - Discussion about accelerator integration and framework from
        CMS presentation:
          - Pointed to JLab workshop as a place to discuss this.
      - Support from referees for common software work.
  - AccelNet:FRESCO support letter
      - See
        [<span class="underline">agenda</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/785568/)
        for project description and draft letter.
      - To clarify, the HSF in the project application is described
        as:
          - *HSF: The HEP Software Foundation (HSF) encourages
            cooperation and common development of software in HEP. The
            HSF hosts a number of software-focused working groups and
            projects where developers are collaborating. These include
            groups on physics generator models, detector simulation
            techniques, event reconstruction techniques and approaches
            to software packaging.*
      - i.e. HSF as a forum to build networks and locate community
        experts.
      - André can you mention CLIC?
          - Yes, now it’s there.
      - Meeting approved the letter of support.

## Google Summer of Code 2019
  - We are accepted as an organisation again.
  - There is a [<span class="underline">meeting for all mentors
    tomorrow at 14h CERN
    time</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/802397/).
      - Will cover how to interact with students and the timeline.
  - Proposal for Advisory Committee:
      - [<span class="underline">https://docs.google.com
        /document/d/17ifO0i4O5JsBVKkcx3j75Z\_iW2bXFnCbqFB2YirlJQw/edit?usp=sharing</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ifO0i4O5JsBVKkcx3j75Z_iW2bXFnCbqFB2YirlJQw/edit?usp=sharing)
      - Need help to select projects against slots (assuming slots \<
        projects).
          - Should also assess given the potential students.
          - 3 people proposed - better if these are not mentors.
          - Criteria: novelty, student rank, impact, etc.
  - *Please review and comment on the proposal in the next week*, aim
    to approve in next week’s meeting.
      - If you would be willing to serve as on the AC please let HSF
        Coordination know.

## HSF/WLCG/OSG Workshop News and Planning
  - [<span class="underline">Indico</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) registration is still open.
      - 221 people registered.
  - There is a Google Sheet linked from the
    [<span class="underline">main
    page</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) to help
    coordinate car sharing from Dulles (you take your own
    responsibility for this\!).

### Session Planning (see [<span class="underline">block timetable</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/timetable/#all))
  - Reminder: David Lange, Michel Jouvin and Graeme Stewart organising
    for HSF.
  - General Sessions:
      - Plenary sessions all fixed now.
  - HSF Sessions:
      - Rooms:
          - Will do a sound check with Amber and LOC next week to
            verify Vidyo connection is acceptable.
      - For planning other HSF Parallel Sessions, see WG activity
        reports below.
  - We will contact Amber about JLab entry requirements (some worries
    that people may need CVs due to changes in DOE rules).

## Activity and Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis
  - Draft agenda for JLAB discussed, here a draft (speakers being
    contacted).
      - 1st session: Where are we now, where are we going ?
          - 20' talk on analysis needs and how they are served today
            (Paul)
          - 20' talk on what's missing today (Andrea)
          - 20’ talk on evolution of HEP computing implications for
            analysis (data distribution, access to resources, hardware
            platforms, ...) (TBD)
          - 30' discussion
      - 2nd session: Technology
          - 20' talk on the future techs (Danilo)
          - 20' talk on Python and frameworks for declarative
            analyses(Jim/Nick)
              - *Check for overlaps with PyHEP session talk on Coffea!*
          - 20' talk on ROOT Declarative framework: RDF (Stefan)
          - 30' discussion
  - Timetable should go into Indico, even if not 100% settled.

### Detector Simulation
  - Agenda for the HSF meeting is finalised -- both talks and
    speakers.
      - Overall philosophy: tried to assign a balance of speakers from
        experiments. Expect each speaker to summarise one topic
        focusing both on their own work and also the perspective from
        other experiments
  - Next topical meeting on 6 March:
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/782508/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/782508/)
      - Need to add agenda entries for that meeting.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
  - Agenda for HSF meeting finalised (talks and speakers).
      - Session 1: real-time analysis, talks from LHCb, ATLAS, CMS,
        ALICE.
      - Session 2: ML/accelerators for reconstruction, talks on LHCb
        tracking, GPU for IceCube, ML in FPGA, JLab reconstruction
        challenges.
      - Plan to have a chat/meeting with all speakers to prepare the
        discussion session.
          - We (WG coords) will look at the talks and prepare 2-3
            questions in advance so that we can have a discussion at
            the workshop.
              - General direction of questions:
                  - Is there room for collaboration and where?
                  - Are upgrades & detectors real-time-analysis ready?
  - Topical meetings: would like to have a shared calendar with other
    groups (e.g., IRIS-HEP) to pick dates for our own without
    conflicts.
      - It’s already hard enough for us to find time where we’re all
        available :).
      - Should we have an HSF + others google calendar?
          - This is possible with the current HSF calendar.
          - Graeme will send [instructions](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/calendar.html) on how to edit and add
            entries.

### Software Tools
  - JLab session well defined.

### PyHEP
  - JLab 1.5h session is finalised. Outside speaker from Anaconda.

### Training
  - [PR in progress](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/pull/477) for listing training events on the HSF website.

### Event Generators
  - Will have regular open meetings every two-weeks, first is this
    afternoon at 16h00 after this meeting (but on a different Vidyo
    room). [<span class="underline">28th Feb
    16h00</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/799316/).

### Licensing
  - Discussion on Gaudi Plugin Service / Gaudi License with CERN KT.
      - Re. code ©CERN, responsibility for re-licensing open source
        code is given to the CERN group that develops the code. In
        this case EP-LBC.
          - Thus is should be fine to relicense from GPLv3 -\>
            Apache2.
      - With that change the intention is to ©Gaudi to CERN, for the
        benefit of the ATLAS and LHCb collaborations; and to apply an
        Apache2 licence.
  - CERN have a webpage that recommends
        GPLv3:
      - [<span class="underline">https://legal.web.cern.ch/licensing/software-terms-use</span>](https://legal.web.cern.ch/licensing/software-terms-use)
      - We think this is anachronistic - Graeme will follow up with
        KT.
  - Still no response from FastJet authors.

### Packaging
  - Held a meeting on 27
        February.
      - [<span class="underline">NixCon</span>](http://nixcon2018.org/)
        (Chris Burr attended).
      - Spack update (HEP people now have merge rights for our
        packages; we also have our own Slack channel).

## CWP

#### Roadmap
  - We got final proofs from CSBS.
      - Eduardo and Michel noticed quite a few errors, which have been
        pointed out to Springer and will be corrected.
