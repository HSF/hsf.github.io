### <span dir="ltr">Reconstruction and Software Triggers</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Lots of ideas from CHEP\!</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Great to see many plenaries/parallels in line with
    HSF & HSF trigger+reco interests</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">E.g. Birds of a Feather sessions (real-time
        analysis in LHC experiments and beyond, organized by TJ Khoo
        and S. Schramm, tracking in trigger organized by A.
        Boveia)</span>

### <span dir="ltr">PyHEP</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">The PyHEP 2019 workshop took place in Abingdon,
    U.K., 16-18 Oct.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2019</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2019).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">55 participants.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">A very successful and appreciated event
        judging by the feedback we got, see the post-workshop survey
        at
        [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/833895/page/18720-surveys</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/833895/page/18720-surveys).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">A pre-workshop questionnaire is also
            available, which shows how things evolved since the first
            workshop, PyHEP 2018 (comparing with it).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Live notes are also available.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We were already asked by several colleagues when
    the next workshop will take place\!</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">US seems a natural location, and US colleagues
        (IRIS-HEP) are keen to help …</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Interest in having the event tag along with
        SciPy, for cross-community exchange.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Training</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Software Carpentry at CERN is next week</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Graeme was asked to join the Scientific Organising
    Committee of the ESCAPE school, which will happen early next
    summer (June): outcome of the</span>
    <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">JENAS</span>](https://jenas-2019.lal.in2p3.fr)
    discussions</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Good opportunity to reach out beyond HEP for
        basic training (ESCAPE grows out of a previous Astroparticle
        school called
        [<span class="underline">ASTERICS</span>](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/18333/))</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Foreseen that we can have a HEP specific
        specialisation at the end of the week</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Event Generators</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Have not resumed activities yet after the summer
    and CHEP. Will do so soon.</span>

        up</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Steve will give a report this evening at the LAWS
    workshop,
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/813325/contributions/3603456/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813325/contributions/3603456/)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Andrea gave a brief report yesterday at the LHCb
    computing workshop,
    (direct link to slides:
    [<span class="underline">ppt</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/831054/contributions/3647475/attachments/1948111/3232657/20191120-LHCb-HSFgenerators-v3.pptx),
    [<span class="underline">pdf</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/831054/contributions/3647475/attachments/1948111/3232656/20191120-LHCb-HSFgenerators-v3.pdf))</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Packaging</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">CHEP
    presentation</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/773049/contributions/3474763/)
    on the group’s progress since Sofia and the current plans for the
    Key4hep stack to be built with Spack was well received</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Heard news from the FAIR experiments that they
        have moved to using Spack</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Belle II would like to also investigate this
        direction</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Nice that this community consensus was covered in
    the [<span class="underline">Track 5 highlights
    talk</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/773049/contributions/3581350/)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Hope to have another meeting before the end of the
    year</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Frameworks</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We had a nice meetup over lunch at CHEP 2019
    involving people from 10 different experiments. It was a chance
    for each person to introduce themselves and bring up issues
    associated with their experiments.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We want to have another meeting before the Winter
    break period.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Quantum Computing</span>
  - *<span dir="ltr">(reported by Riccardo M. Bianchi)</span>*
  - <span dir="ltr">New interest in the HEP community.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Riccardo Bianchi had a discussion with Federico
    Carminati: Openlab has contacts with major QC players (IBM,
    Google, …) who would like to have pilot projects with “CERN” (for
    industry partners, CERN is equal to HEP…); however, unfortunately,
    we currently don’t have HEP use cases to establish partnerships
    with industries.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">HSF QC & Openlab would like to organize a workshop
    together; let’s say, next Spring. The draft idea is to have
    vendors presenting their platforms. After that, there would be a
    HEP-only session to discuss the potential uses and establish
    realistic use-cases. Then, there will be a follow-up session,
    where HEP will present their with vendors to set up joint
    projects. Alberto Di Meglio, Federico Carminati, Riccardo M.
    Bianchi, and Maurizio Pierini are now brainstorming on how to
    organize HEP working groups on QC</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Federico and Riccardo think it is important to ask
    vendors first about what they are interested in and what their
    platforms can offer; then we can come up with realistic use cases
    which are also interesting for vendors and feasible on their
    infrastructure, avoiding dead ends.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">There was a Google Cirq Bootcamp at CERN,
    organized by Google & OpenLab, last week. Riccardo went and
    established some contacts with “Google QC Partnerships” team.
    Also, a draft of a joint project has been prepared by Markus
    (Google), Federico (Openlab), and Riccardo (HSF) to test on the
    Openlab cluster a new port of Google Cirq to Intel. Google will
    contact Intel to port their Cirq library to the Intel Quantum
    simulator. Openlab will provide the cluster. HSF QC, and possibly
    the CERN Theory Div., will be involved to test code on the new
    platform.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">At the Google Bootcamp Riccardo shared the HSF QC
    mailing lists with the participants and new members have joined
    that.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Also, Federico would like to invite the members of
    the QC openlab mailing list to join the HSF list and close the
    former.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">P.S. If interested, you can take a look at the
    Bootcamp’s slides and hands-on instructions here:
    [<span class="underline">https://sites.google.com/view/cirq-bootcamps/when-where/geneva</span>](https://sites.google.com/view/cirq-bootcamps/when-where/geneva)</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Visualisation</span>
  - *<span dir="ltr">(reported by Riccardo M. Bianchi)</span>*
  - <span dir="ltr">Phoenix:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Phoenix
        ([<span class="underline">https://github.com/HSF/phoenix</span>](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix))
        is developed under the HSF aegis. Phoenix was started by ATLAS
        (*Ed Moyse*), then LHCb (*Ben Couturier*) and CMS (*Tom
        McCauley*) joined to integrate and test their data files and
        geometries in the tool.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Phoenix was awarded with a Google Summer
        of Code student, Emilio Cortina Labra, last Summer. Emilio
        worked very hard: he refactored the structure, updated the UI,
        and added many features to the tool.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Phoenix was presented at the Paris “Learning
        to Discover” workshop
        ([<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/847626/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/847626/)),
        where Emilio run a Phoenix hands-on tutorial.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">A new Topical Workshop?:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">I saw some activities in visualization within
        the experiments recently (and at CHEP2019); I think it could
        be the right time to have another topical workshop. I’ll ask
        about potential interest on the Visualization list.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Workshops</span>

### <span dir="ltr">HSF WLCG Workshop in Lund, 11-15 May 2020</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">International organizing committee is in the
    process of choosing the location…</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">One location is the main University Building
        (iconic and in the centre of Lund)</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Or a hotel, which would have very professional
        setup and would be smooth</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Price will be about 300€ (+50€ for
        conference dinner), but the university does not include
        lunches</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">lunches can be cheap in the centre of
            town</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">If the weather is nice, there are a lot of
            places where one can take lunch to go and sit in the park
            (Lundagård). We could inquire if we can put out some
            standing tables but it’s unclear if we can do it as it’s a
            public park.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Full description of two locations here:
        [<span class="underline">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLLA4NqyCa5MpYJVseflX-LiHwKFu3CvDp5j\_83PgAM/edit?usp=sharing</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lLLA4NqyCa5MpYJVseflX-LiHwKFu3CvDp5j_83PgAM/edit?usp=sharing)</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Pre-CHEP, Analysis Systems: From Future Facilities to Final Plots (2-3 November)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Workshop was judged a success - people rather
    pleased with it</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">2 x ½ days was the correct length</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Plenary session on Saturday was good to set
        the scene, but has the usual issue that \<5 people contribute
        about 80% of any discussion</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Interactive session was innovative and people
        liked it, yet we could improve some aspects of the
        organisation:</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">People should know their challenge topic
            earlier (we wanted to give people time after Saturday to
            choose this, but this meant the assignments did go out too
            late)</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">It was important to let people choose
            their group or groups if they wanted to do so</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">The brainwriting was hard for some groups
            (not all) to get started on - having a pre-discussion was
            fine in these cases, see first point</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Sizing the groups to be about 6 was the
            right decision, (our initial idea for larger groups would
            not have worked as well)</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">The group and supergroup discussions were
            really useful and people liked them</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">The final plenary feedback session was too
            long (back to the problem of very few contributors in
            these very big sessions)</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Organisers will meet next week with the aim of
        providing a very short summary and outcomes document</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Latin American Workshop on Software and Computing Challenges in HEP (Mexico, Nov 20-23)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Ongoing, report next meeting</span>

## <span dir="ltr">AOB</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Went back to Google Docs for this week’s minutes,
    due to problems with CodiMD and people who did not have full CERN
    accounts</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Positive feedback on the CodiMD idea, with
        direct MD editing</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Any update on EduGAIN authorisation to write
        to CERN CodiMD?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Not yet</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Or should we use the
        [<span class="underline">public CodiMD
        instance</span>](https://demo.codimd.org/COseSwVnQRuYOAWpHC756Q?both)?</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">*Decision:* we can use the public CodiMD for now -
        N.B. this is only for writing minutes, no long term need for
        it after the minutes are posted</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Next meeting…</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Next week is Thanksgiving (28 November), so
        reconvene *5 December*</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We had some discussion about the 2 week cadence
    for these coordination meetings</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">This was decided, but the weeks themselves
        remained quite dynamic (i.e. not regularly in even or odd
        weeks)</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Hard for people to plan other
            activities</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">We probably do need to be fairly flexible, but
        would it be preferred that we picked a baseline to prefer
        (N.B. this is an *odd* week)</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Yes, this would be a good idea - we’ll do this
        for next year’s meeting</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">ECFA discussion of early-career researchers on
    input to the European Strategy update</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Computing & Software discussion
        [<span class="underline">slides</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/847002/contributions/3639751/attachments/1945377/3229717/ECFA-ECR_Computing__Software_Working_Group_Report1.pdf).</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Should think about coordination list vs. people
    who are active organisers for HSF</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Coordination list has become rather
        broad</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Sometimes not clear how to contact HSF</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Could setup a smaller management/executive
        list?</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">We should think about this and decide if we
        propose any changes.</span>
