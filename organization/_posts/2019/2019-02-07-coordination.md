## Google Summer of Code 2019
  - See slides attached to the
    [<span class="underline">agenda</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/785565/).
  - Please subscribe to the mailing list:
    [<span class="underline">hep-software-foundation-google-summer-of-code@googlegroups.com</span>](mailto:hep-software-foundation-google-summer-of-code@googlegroups.com).
  - To contact the admins, use
    [<span class="underline">hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com</span>](mailto:hsf-gsoc-admin@googlegroups.com).
  - If Google accept us as an organisation (26 February), do we know
    how many slots we get?
      - Not at that time. We provide, by 25 March, a min/max number of
        projects we would like to have (this is when students apply to
        Google with their projects). Google then make an allocation of
        slots.

## HSF/WLCG/OSG Workshop News and Planning
  - [<span class="underline">Indico</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) - registration is open.
      - 169 people registered now.
      - Early registration ends on 8 February - please register *now*.
  - There is a Google Sheet linked from the
    [<span class="underline">main
    page</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) to help
    coordinate car sharing from Dulles (you take your own
    responsibility for this\!).
      - If you are arriving/travelling from another airport you can
        also use that spreadsheet (just make it clear which airport
        you will be at).

### Session Planning (see [<span class="underline">block timetable</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/timetable/#all))
  - Reminder: David Lange, Michel Jouvin and Graeme Stewart organising
    for HSF.
  - General Sessions:
      - Monday, Friday plenary sessions fixed.
      - New Workflows, New Facilities (Tuesday AM).
          - Benedikt Hegner and Maria Girone are convening.
          - Session now planned in concert with Tuesday PM first
            session
              - See detailed timetable
  - HSF Sessions:
      - *Please fill in a first version of your detailed timetable in
        the coming week, even if not all slots are confirmed*
          - All session convenors have management rights, let us know
            if you have any problems.
          - And do remember it’s a workshop - schedule generous
            discussion time\!
      - Software on Accelerators (2 slots).
          - Graeme, Michel, David L are convening
              - Confirmed talks on Accelerator Technologies, Framework
                Integration, Patatrack, ALICE GPU Algorithms, MadGraph
                on GPUs.
      - Timetable:
          - Analysis and Simulation have their second sessions
            Thursday AM 9h-10h30.
          - Software Tools moved to Thursday 16h-17h30.
          - Still likely that smaller rooms would be available for any
            BoFs, but try to let us know ASAP if you want them.
      - Rooms:
          - Monday, Friday plenaries from auditorium can be broadcast, but no Vidyo.
          - Tuesday, Wednesday - HSF parallel sessions in Room F113
            which has Vidyo and 100 capacity.
          - Thursday we will need to make some use of the auditorium,
            which has poor Vidyo.
              - For groups spread between Wednesday and Thursday, try
                to have the Vidyo critical part on Wednesday.
              - Graeme will check again with Amber what could be done
                in the auditorium to setup Vidyo for smaller,
                parallel, sessions.
      - For planning other HSF Parallel Sessions, see WG activity
        reports below.

## Activity and Working Group Updates
General points:
  - Reminder to make sure your WG page has:
      - Brief description of the interests of the group
      - Information on how to join the group’s mailing list
      - Information on how to contact the convenors (convenor list or
        individual emails)
      - A link to the group’s Indico category

### Detector Simulation
  - Not too much news - agenda for workshop is being prepared, 4/6
    talks confirmed.
  - Fast Simulation with Machine Learning, 6 March 2019.
      - 3 confirmed talks, 1 pending.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
  - JLab:
      - Confirmed talks: for speakers, see agenda (we will do before
        tomorrow).
      - Unconfirmed talks: ALICE, CMS (both agreed), LSST (losing
        hope).
      - Strong request to have Vidyo meetings accessible from outside
        JLab - how?
          - Currently ok for Reco sessions - F113.
  - Meetings:
      - First meeting: had to skip the 6th because of overlap with CMS
        week.
      - Tentative plan to have the various collaborations discuss
        trigger systems and then reco software, starting with ATLAS
        and CMS as they already had this exercise internally, then
        going two by two (meetings should be limited to 1h30). After
        this, topical meetings.

### Software Tools
  - 2 of 3 talks confirmed, Packaging and Static Analysis.

### PyHEP
  - Skeleton agenda for JLab session up on Indico.
  - We are targeting to have the session finalised next week.

### Training
  - IRIS-HEP meeting this week focused on training.
      - Caterina’s Q: can non-IRIS-HEPpers peek at minutes?
      - Don't think they have minutes, but instead put the meetings on
        YouTube.
  - [IRIS-HEP website](http://iris-hep.org) has links to mailing lists and
    Indico.

### Event Generators
  - We finally have a page on the HSF web site and mailing lists for
    WG members. Included by default the workshop organisers, then
    invited all workshop participants, many of whom replied and asked
    to be included. Please join if interested\! See
    [<span class="underline">https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/generators.html</span>](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/generators.html)
      - We will probably have a first meeting in the next two weeks.
      - Aim to have meetings every other week from then onwards.
  - Included the tex sources and latest available pdf of the CWP
    chapter on the [HSF documents GitHub](https://github.com/HSF/documents/tree/master/CWP/papers/HSF-CWP-2017-11_generators), and linked it from the HSF
    site. This will not become an arXiv.
  - Some (slow) progress on the workshop writeup. We need to advance
    faster, aim to be ready before a related talk at ACAT.
  - In contact with the madgraph team about GPUs. One key team member
    was absent in the last weeks, but we hope to make more progress
    now.

### Licensing
  - Still chasing up CERN KT and FastJet authors.

## AOB
  - Graeme absent next week - try to get another coordinator to run
    the meeting
  - (Ongoing) URL checks on website are unreliable; another URL check
    code could be tried to see if that improves things.
  - Working on an update to the instructions for converting Google Doc
    -\> Word -\> Markdown.
      - See Andrea’s PR:
