-   [*Indico*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) - registration is
    open; 40 people signed up at the moment
    -   Please sign up quickly for planning (and early registration, up
        to 1 Feb)

Session Planning (see [*block timetable*](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/timetable/#all))
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-   Reminder: David Lange, Michel Jouvin and Graeme Stewart organising
    for HSF.
-   General Sessions:
    -   Opening plenary session from HEP experiments and other
        communities (Monday)
        -   Future plans, emphasis on areas for common R&D and tools.
    -   Technology watch and networking (Tuesday AM).

    -   Closing Session, visionary talk and discussion on the future
        (Friday).
-   HSF Sessions:
    -   Software on Accelerators (2 slots).
        -   Graeme, Michel, David L will convener; send suggestions
            (generators, tracking, etc. style projects)
    -   Simulation (2 slots, with one in parallel with other HSF
        sessions; idea is to use first slot for topics of general

        in focus)
    -   Reconstruction (2 slots, 1 “parallel”)
    -   Analysis (2 slots, 1 “parallel”)
    -   Software Tools (1 slot)

    -   Priority will be workshop topics/speakers (given deadline of Feb
        1st).
-   Planning to have informal talks with ATLAS community during the last
    week of January (P&P week) - goal: understand how this WG could be
    useful (how the community/conveners of trigger and reconstruction
    see it).

Quantum Computing
-----------------
-   WG page is a [*PR*](https://github.com/HSF/hsf.github.io/pull/416)

Packaging
---------
-   Next meeting end of the month.

PyHEP
-----
-   Planning workshop session.

CWP
===
### General Matters and Roadmap
-   CWP Roadmap was accepted by Springer for CSBS.
    -   CERN agreed to pay the Open Access fee.

### Publication status for Individual WG Papers
-   **Event/Data Processing Frameworks**
    -   Done!
        [*https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07861*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07861).

AOB
===
-   Propose to organize the “Latin American Workshop on S&C Challenges
    in HEP” under the umbrella of HSF in Mexico.
    -   3 days workshop involving the LA institutes. Tentative dates
        November 20-22
    -   The goal is to explore and consolidate new partnership
        opportunities between Latin American institutions in S&C
        research within HEP. It includes strengthening existing
        collaborative efforts of Latin American groups with
        international HEP laboratories and identifying future research
        interests in common.
