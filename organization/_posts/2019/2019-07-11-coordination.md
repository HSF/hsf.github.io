## News, general matters
  - HPCs and GPUs - cost model and benchmarking WG
      - WLCG Management Board has set up a group to work on benchmarking of GPUs in
        particular. 
      - This is to anticipate that some funding agencies might offer GPU resources
        as part of their WLCG pledge.
      - Some notes and the charge in this
        [<span class="underline">Google
        Doc</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rAr9RN_CcvmiA8aC0thh5aINeUgNl44mOiHcx2RweZI/edit).
      - Note that at the moment we don’t have many (any?) workloads
        that we could run at any scale.
      - We are asked to have at least 1 HSF representative in the
        group.
      - Would anyone be keen to participate?
          - David; Graeme; Andrea V; Hadrien G (all can contribute a
            bit).
  - EDM4HEP
      - As an outcome of the Bologna Future Collider Software Workshop
        we had the [<span class="underline">first
        meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/832559/) of the
        EDM4HEP group this week.
      - HSF is acting as an umbrella.
      - ILC, CLIC, CEPC, FCC all present, we reviewed LCIO and
        FCC-EDM.
      - Had to change some of our normal practices to collaborate with
        Chinese colleagues (Google blocked).
          - CERN e-group instead of Google Group
            ([<span class="underline">hsf-edm4hep-wg@cern.ch</span>](mailto:hsf-edm4hep-wg@cern.ch)).
          - Overleaf instead of Google Docs.
  - ECFA Presentation
      - Graeme will give a talk on Computing and Software Challenges
        at the ECFA session of EPS-HEP.
      - [<span class="underline">Draft
        talk</span>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dGJHa2v1CbXuiYCQ3c9XxFKcEBfsxQS4ptSb34cZDFY/edit?usp=sharing) - comments welcome.

## Google Summer of Code 2019
  - Second coding period.
  - All students passed, but a few ‘alerts’ to watch out for.
  - Mostly going well.

### Google Season of Docs
  - Application period ended.
      - 5 applications for 3 proposals (DIRAC, Rucio, ROOT).
      - Mentors are looking at these.
  - Our choices by 23 July.
  - Seems Google will only finance one project.
  - August for community bonding, three months work.
  - How to select?
      - Filter and use the same committee as GSoC - Peter, Pere and
        Michel.

## Activity and Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis
  - Next meeting will be on the 22nd July on “Computing infrastructure
    for future data analysis”, as a precursor to this year’s pre-CHEP

### Software Tools
  - Topic for meetings after the summer break:
      - A follow-up discussion on Trident
      - A presentation/demonstration from
        [<span class="underline">Tuning and Analysis Utilities
        (TAU)</span>](https://www.cs.uoregon.edu/research/tau/home.php)
        people
          - Trying to pin down someone from the team
      - A discussion GPU profiling
          - Need to see if we can contact someone from NVIDIA (via
            OpenLab)
      - A discussion on Hadrien’s valgrind plugin for numerical
        stability
      - A discussion on IDEs, i.e. see if we can invite someone from
        Microsoft on VSCode
          - There is some recent development on the
            [<span class="underline">remote
            development</span>](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview)
          - (Gordon) I’ve been using this tool for a while now, and it
            was pretty amazing. At a local group I saw a guy present
            who was partly responsible in MS for the remote
            development code. Shall I see if I can get in touch with
            him?
              - Serhan : That’d be fantastic Gordon, thank you very
                much.
      - A talk on Mutation Testing
        ([<span class="underline">mull-project</span>](https://github.com/mull-project/mull))
      - A talk on test-suites he added to Phoenix (GSOC student,
        timescale?)
      - A talk on
        [<span class="underline">Nexus</span>](https://codimd.web.cern.ch/p/ByKnsM5xH#/)
        (a web app to store and organize binaries, libraries, RPMs
        etc.)
          - That would also be interesting for the packaging group.

### PyHEP
  - Preparations for the 2nd workshop, PyHEP 2019, have started. An
    announcement email will be sent next Monday or Tuesday at the
    latest.  
    \- Workshop taking place in the UK, at
    The Cosener’s House, Abingdon.  
    \- Will run 2.5 days, October 16-18.  
    \- We welcome input and suggestions from the HSF already at this
    stage.  
    \- Facilities can accommodate 80 people.  
    \- Organisation together with Ben Krikler, a CMS colleague and
    [<span class="underline">UK Software Sustainability
    Institute</span>](https://www.software.ac.uk/) 2019 fellow.
  - The WG is organising topical meetings for after the Summer
    break.  
    \- The first one is penciled down for September 11th at 17h (same
    time as the Software Forum). It will be on fitting tools and their
    design, hopefully engaging with non-HEP communities.  
    \- Agenda is being put in place and an advertisement will come out
    soon.

### Training
  - See
    [<span class="underline">slides</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/785587/contributions/3266731/attachments/1776030/3097240/HSF_TEO_WG_update_11July_2019-2.pdf)
    attached to the agenda...
  - Software Carpentry @ CERN, 16-18 October.
      - (Unfortunately now clashes with PyHEP, but constraints are
        quite binding and we should go ahead.)
      - Order maybe better as Shell / Git / Python / C++?
      - Is 1 day enough to do much that’s useful in C++
          - ROOT focus may help, but teach modern programming (not
            ‘98), use ROOT7 interfaces
          - Is ROOT7 stable enough?
              - A lot still experimental though
              - To discuss with ROOT team

### Event Generators
  - Subjective report from Andrea (apologies, in another meeting)
      - Last [<span class="underline">meeting on June
        27</span>](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/2019/06/27/generators.html).
        Many thanks for all the work and contributions\!
          - Further progress in accounting analysis, close to
            completion. Over the 2017 MC the fraction of time spent on
            generation (with respect to the MC production chain) is
            17% for ATLAS and 9.3% for CMS. Taking into account MC is
            around 70% of ATLAS and 50% of CMS of overall WLCG
            computing, this means generation is around \~12% for ATLAS
            and \~5% for CMS of overall WLCG computing. Still larger
            for ATLAS than CMS, but only by a factor \~2, not 10.
          - Report from Les Houches workshop in June: a lot of
            discussion about negative event weights and how their
            impact could be reduced to decrease CPU budget.
          - Top physics WG considering ttbar sample sharing between
            ATLAS and CMS.
          - Somewhat outside our usual scope, but welcome in the HSF
            WG: discussion of a proposal for Particle Data Group
            particle ID’s extensions.
      - Would like to define a few standard configurations for similar
        physics productions using different generators (to use for
        profiling and also as standard candles for hardware
        benchmarking and software comparisons. No progress on this.
      - Event generators are often discussed as a candidate workflow
        to exploit GPU based resources (e.g. HPC supercomputers). But
        we have not discussed this yet in detail in any meeting and I
        am not aware of any significant progress in this area. One WG
        member recently informed us that he is starting some work on
        this.

### Event Delivery Forum
  - Doodling for first meeting at the end of this month:
      - [<span class="underline">https://doodle.com/poll/n3ykm6knp6tv5uif</span>](https://doodle.com/poll/n3ykm6knp6tv5uif).

### Packaging
  - Met yesterday, minutes available
    [<span class="underline">here</span>](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/organization/2019/07/10/packaging.html).
    We discussed the Key4HEP stack project.
  - Next meeting 11 September.

### Frameworks
  - We have 9 nominees for the working group.
  - Names have been circulated and we requested comments by 25 August.
      - This is very long, but it’s summer and it would be hard to
        converge and organise anything before this time.
      - Comments to
        [<span class="underline">hsf-wg-search-committee@cern.ch</span>](mailto:hsf-wg-search-committee@cern.ch)
        (maps to Graeme, Liz and Michel)

### Visualisation
  - Phoenix GSoC project is going very well.
      - Github:
        [<span class="underline">https://github.com/HSF/phoenix</span>](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix)
      - Live demo:
        [<span class="underline">http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/</span>](http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/phoenix/)
  - Experiment independent in browser toolkit, easy to use.
  - Would be good to present this.

## Workshops

### Pre-CHEP (2-3 November)
  - Wait for next Analysis WG meeting for progress.

### Next HSF/WLCG Workshop
  - Call for hosting institutes is out.
      - 3 interested so far.
  - Considering the constraints in May and June
      - June now looks very difficult (LHCC, LHCb Week, ATLAS S\&C
        Week, ATLAS Week)
      - In May 4-8 or 11-15 look possible (18-22 is Ascension Week,
        25-29 DIRAC Users Workshop)
  - Are there any more known clashes for **May 4-8** or **May 11-15**?
  - It would be very good to pin down a favoured date *now*.
      - We agreed that 11-15 May would be favoured.
  - Can we extend the deadline for institutes?
      - Early September should be ok - Graeme will discuss with the
        other organisers.

## AOB
  - Git repository for Harvester.
      - Harvester is PanDA’s new workload submission engine (deals
        with HPCs, dynamic cloud resources, other non-standard
        resources)
      - But it’s actually backend agnostic, so a request to host the
        code as an HSF project.
          - Part of Intelligent Data Delivery System (iDDS).
      - N.B. similar to things we currently do host, like CREST and
        Phoenix.
      - Agreed.
  - Summer break now, when to resume meetings?
      - Resume 29 August [as discussed after the meeting, on realising that
        5 September is Jeûne Genevois CERN holiday].
