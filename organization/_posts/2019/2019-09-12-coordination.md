    matters was given on Tuesday:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/754734/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/754734/)</span>.
      - <span dir="ltr">Questions from referees about C++ training (is
        it too late?).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Closed session quickly touched on “modern”
        languages. Need for C++ training was stressed again, as
        performance is critical to us.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">EP R&D on Experimental Technologies:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">This R&D activity has been funded by CERN,
        including a software work package</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Four projects will be supported:</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Turnkey Software Stacks (optimised and
            integrated stack aimed at detector developments).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Reconstruction at High Pileup (trackers
            and high granularity calorimeters).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Faster Simulation (machine learning
            algorithms for speed-up).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Analysis Facilities (new ROOT RDataFrame
            and object store integration).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">This work will ramp up in 2020 and will run
        until at least 2024.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">If you are aware of people who might like to
        work on these projects, as CERN Fellows, please let Graeme
        know.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Google Summer of Code 2019</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">It’s done\! 29 out of 33 students successfully
    completed their projects.</span>
  - Well done to mentors, students and, most of all, our coordinators: Javier, Andre and Antoine.

## <span dir="ltr">Activity and Working Group Updates</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Detector Simulation</span>

        - Salle Dirac.
      - <span dir="ltr">The idea is to have an installation of TAU on
        CVMFS so that people can play with conveniently. How best to
        do this?</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Depending on the feedback, can have a hands-on
        tutorial when Sameer is in Europe (December or later).</span>

      - <span dir="ltr">Rooms are booked\!</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">We are now looking for people to be helpers
        for the students - requirement is intermediate level skills in
        Python, git, shell</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://doodle.com/poll/7n9dpbhhmyk9hcm2</span>](https://doodle.com/poll/7n9dpbhhmyk9hcm2).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Please sign up to help\!</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">We need:</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">A poster to raise the profile (anyone good
            at graphics?).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Decide the final curriculum and find the
            tutors.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Event Generators</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Slow restart after the summer, no meetings
    yet.</span>

    based on the work that Hobbs Willet (CERN Summer Student)
    did.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Next meeting planned for 9 October,
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/category/7975/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/category/7975/).</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Frameworks</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">New convenors appointed:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Chris Jones, FNAL, CMS.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Kyle Knoepfel, FNAL, Neutrino
        Community.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Attila Krasznahorkay, CERN, ATLAS.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Had a discussion meeting yesterday to plan first
    activities.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Idea is to have a couple of initial meetings
        by CHEP to build the WG community.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Licensing</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Liz, Graeme and Michel met and decided it was not
    worth pursuing with FastJet developers in the short term, not very
    collaborative on the topic and not really available. The
    perspective remains a new jet clustering framework optimized for
    parallelism (US project) : details not available yet but will be
    done with proper credit to algorithm contributors.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Problem is FastJet license is GPL, but ATLAS
        and CMS want to have their offline code under an Apache2
        license.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Andrea: it would be best to inform Fastjet
        developers well in advance that a US group is considering
        rewriting a Fastjet-like software using their ideas. We must
        be extra careful not to alienate people (especially from the
        theory community) even more. Andrea will send a message to Liz
        about this.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Andrea - HEPiX benchmarking WG would like to know
    what the licensing is for packaged experiment software.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">To be checked but not necessarily a problem if
        only the binaries are distributed</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">The people following this in the HepixWG are
        Michele Michelotto and Domenico Giordano. Andrea will tell
        them to get in contact with Michel and Graeme (thanks to both
        for volunteering to help\!).</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Workshops</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Next HSF/WLCG Workshop</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Three bids: DESY, Sweden, Romania.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Bid documents are attached to the
        agenda.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Swedish bid has in fact 2 locations (2
        sub-bids).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">DESY only possible May 4-8</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Dates highly constrained: May 4-8 or May
    11-15.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Short presentations at the GDB on
    Wednesday:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/739882/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/739882/).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">GDB was supportive of DESY bid for reasons of
        cost.</span>

  - <span dir="ltr">Open to responses now, or you can contact Graeme, Michel and David L. until early next week, or email [<span class="underline">wlcg-hsf-workshop-2020-organisation@cern.ch</span>](mailto:wlcg-hsf-workshop-2020-organisation@cern.ch).</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Pre-CHEP, Analysis Systems: From Future Facilities to Final Plots (2-3 November)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Planning now well advanced.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Saturday we have a series of talks to inspire
        people:</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Run 3 Analysis Challenge.</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Run 4 / HL-LHC Analysis Challenge.</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">2 talks about facilities, including
            IRIS-HEP work around DOMA (confirmed: X. Espinal).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Analysis workflow.</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Machine learning (as part of the
            workflow).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Analysis preservation and its impact on
            analysis workflow (confirmed: Lukas Heinrich).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Sunday we plan interactive sessions around 4
        key questions:</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Facilities - how to organise for
            HL-LHC?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Interactive Analysis - what are the needs
            and challenges?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Machine Learning - how to manage training
            and inference; what is the scale of training and who does
            it?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Analysis Model - what are viable models
            for the future? Key points to improve or change.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We have a very large level of participation, 160
    people (makes Sunday a challenge to organise, but we think we can
    manage).</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Latin American Workshop on Software and Computing Challenges in HEP (Mexico, Nov 20-23)</span>

<span dir="ltr"></span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Some progress in getting some speakers (e.g.
    Gordon Watts). Looking for another IRIS-HEP speaker.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Will contact HSF WG convenors as well.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Still looking for sponsorship.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Registration is open. Ask HSF Coordinators to
    circulate information to their experiments.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">AOB</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Stefan Roiser will go to the UK RSE conference
    next week, presenting software institute ideas.</span>
