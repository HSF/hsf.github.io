## News, general matters
-   We have been asked by the INDIGO-Next project to provide a letter of
    support for their proposal.
    -   Project initiated many useful developments in distributed
        computing - analysis capture and preservation.
    -   [<span class="underline">Draft
        Letter</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16aMNMQ4gEL8Nuk7-oK3TcnKt5TCATb_DYTTANEWJ_mI/edit?usp=sharing)
        was approved by the meeting.
-   CERN Computing Seminar next week is interesting [<span
    class="underline">Hardware acceleration with GPUs and
    FPGAs</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/790345/) (speaker from
    Oracle), Tuesday 29 January, 16h CERN time.
    - No Vidyo, but recording usually posted after the event.

## Google Summer of Code 2019
-   Remember the HSF deadline: *February 4.*
-   Presentation [<span class="underline">last
    week</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/785562/) had all the
    details.

## HSF/WLCG/OSG Workshop News and Planning
-   [<span
    class="underline">Indico</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) -
    registration is open.
    -   Early registration ends on 1 February - please register now.
-   There is a Google Sheet linked from the [<span
    class="underline">main
    page</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/) to help
    coordinate car sharing from Dulles (you take your own
    responsibility for this!).
    -   If you are arriving/travelling from another airport you can also
        use that spreadsheet (just make it clear which airport you
        will be at).

### Session Planning (see [<span class="underline">block timetable</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/759388/timetable/#all))
-   Reminder: David Lange, Michel Jouvin and Graeme Stewart organising
    for HSF.
-   General Sessions:
    -   Opening plenary session from HEP experiments and other
        communities (Monday)
        -   Confirmed talks from LHC Experiments, DUNE, Belle II, Dark
            Matter, Electron-Ion Consortium, LIGO, IceCube; yet to
            confirm LSST, Lightsources.
        -   Plus discussion on WLCG future evolution.
    -   Closing Session, visionary talk and discussion on the future
        (Friday).
        -   We will also hear about funding news from various projects -
            important to have a community coordinated approach.
            -   DE (Thomas Kuhr)
            -   UK, IRIS (Pete Clarke)
            -   US, IRIS-HEP (Pete Elmer)
            -   If you are aware of any other projects that have secured
                funding for software efforts can you let us know?
        -   Amber Boehnlein has agreed to do the final talk.
-   HSF Sessions:
    -   *Please fill in a first version of your detailed timetable in
        the coming week, even if not all slots are confirmed.*
        -   And do remember it’s a workshop - schedule generous
            discussion time!
    -   Software on Accelerators.
        -   Graeme, Michel, David L are convening
            -   Confirmed talks on Accelerator Technologies, Framework
                Integration, Patatrack, ALICE GPU Algorithms, MadGraph
                on GPUs
            -   Still a number of other possible topics to follow-up and
                confirm.
    -   For other HSF Parallel Sessions, see WG activity reports below.
    -   One spillover BoF slot, Thursday late PM.
        -   Logistics of the Wednesday afternoon 3-way split might
            entail moving some sessions to this slot.

## Activity and Working Group Updates
General points:
-   hsf-wg-convenors list can now edit the [<span class="underline">HSF
    community
    calendar</span>](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=e4v33e1a1drbncdle1n03ahpcs%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=Europe/Amsterdam)
    to add their meetings.
-   Reminder:
    -   Please set up mailing lists and advertise them on your group
        page.

### Data Analysis
-   [<span class="underline">Kickoff
    meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/782504/) yesterday.
    Lot of good inputs being now processed. Next step on Feb 13th more
    focused on existing technologies and ideas in development for data
    analysis.
-   JLAB WS agenda still to be discussed.

### Detector Simulation
-   [<span class="underline">Topical
    meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/782507/) next week -
    Fast sim from the LHC experiments.
-   6 March Machine Learning flavour.
-   Workshop - sending invitations, 6 talks planned and speakers
    invited.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
-   In each session we aim to have:
    -   15 min + 5 min -&gt; 4 talks + 10 min for general discussion.
-   Contacted several potential speakers for HSF/WCLG/OSG workshop:
    -   A comprehensive real-time analysis model at the LHCb experiment
        (waiting for the final confirmation).
    -   Similar “real-time analysis” request soon to be sent to
        ATLAS/CMS.
        -   We have tentative speakers, then speakers committees will
            decide.
    -   Using FPGAs to accelerate machine learning inference
        (confirmed).
    -   ML in industry: forecasting traffic by Ximantis (waiting for the
        final confirmation).
    -   Expand possibility of having talks from ALICE O2, DUNE
        track/reco, Belle II mails sent out, waiting for response.
    -   We already received other proposals - to be discussed among
        convenors.
-   We aim to have a kickoff Reco&Trigger meeting on 6th Feb.
    -   Introduction to the WG.
    -   Open call for contributions.
    -   Thematic meetings to come later.
-   Ongoing activity: We try to get a wide input/feedback about the
    needs from the HEP community: discussions with trigger/reco
    responsible people among experiments.

### Software Tools
-   We aim to have three main topics : monitoring/profiling tools,
    static analyzers, and packaging.
-   Looking for \~3 talks (i.e. one on each subject) w/ 50% talk 50%
    discussion.
-   Solicited input from the community via e-mail. Can possibly
    accommodate a few lightning talks if there is any interest.

### PyHEP
-   Workshop session at JLab workshop:
    -   Skeleton agenda finalised - lightning talks and 2 topical talks.
    -   1 lightning talk confirmed.
    -   As for the rest: invitations out or about to go out.
    -   Still have space for 1-2 lightning talks. Do get in touch!

### Licensing
-   FastJet authors contacted again.
-   CERN KT were contacted to properly establish a procedure for
    relicensing code that is copyrighted to CERN (in particular,
    Gaudi).

### Packaging
-   [<span class="underline">Next
    meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/790021/) scheduled
    for 30 January.

### Software Forum
-   Reminder: we have the forum slot Wednesday 17-18h CERN time every odd week (13
    February + N \* 2 weeks).
    -   Available for any HSF meetings
-   With the new working groups starting some activity has moved out of
    the ‘general’ session.
    -   However, for presentations on general problems, solutions and
        links to other sciences this still has relevance.
