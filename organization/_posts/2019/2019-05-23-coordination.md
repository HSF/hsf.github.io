## Activity and Working Group Updates

### Detector Simulation
  - Topical meeting held on 8 May on compute accelerators.
  - Meeting 12 June, Detector Geometry Description Tools:
      - [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/816485/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/816485/)
      - Please send us suggestions for talks and speakers\!

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
  - Meeting yesterday on Atlas/CMS trigger systems/operations based on
    previous joint discussions between the two experiments. 20-30
    attendees.
  - [Next meeting])https://indico.cern.ch/event/823263/) on 5th June:
      - Topic: Algorithms and data structures to efficiently exploit
        many-core architectures - one of the topics described in CWP.
      - Two contributions from LHCb are confirmed. This will be a
        first in hopefully a series of related discussions on
        algorithmic approaches. We’ve just asked for
        suggestions/volunteers for contributions on our mailing list.

### Training
  - Group has had two meetings in the last few weeks. Will ask for an
    update in a future meeting.
      - Join the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/hsf-training-wg)
        to follow this.

### Event Generators

      - Self nominations welcome.

## Workshops

### Latin American HSF Workshop
  - Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México, Nov. 20-22 2019,
    under the “auspices” of HSF.
  - Mostly a gathering of the HEP Latin American community interested
    in S&C with the goal to meet each other and discuss opportunities
    for collaboration within the region and with the international
    community.
  - The scientific program is in the works.
  - There will be invitations to members of the international
    community and registration will be open to everyone. The event
    will be announced in the near future through the HSF list.
  - We will put this into the calendar.
