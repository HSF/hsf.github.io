## News, general matters
  - Report from Future Colliders Software Workshop, last week in
    Bologna:
      - Consensus was reached among all communities for future
        colliders to develop a Common Turnkey Software Stack (called
        from now Key4HEP), connecting and extending the individual
        packages to enable a complete data processing framework.
        1.  Key4HEP should be easy to use (for librarians,
            developers, users), easy to set up, easy to deploy, easy
            to extend.
      - Discussed the main components and reached some agreement:
        2.  Identified the EDM as an essential component. Agreed to
            develop one based on PODIO and inspired by LCIO.
        3.  For the framework, it was agreed that the best candidate
            to date is the Gaudi framework as the starting point. LC
            community will continue to use Marlin for the time being.
      - Identified the names for the ‘facilitators’ team that will
        drive the development of Key4HEP.
  - [Efficient Scientific Computing School, Bertinoro, Italy, 21-26
    October 2019](https://web.infn.it/esc/)
      - The aim of the ESC school is to offer the participants the
        opportunity to improve their computing competences, learning
        from qualified and experienced scientists how to best exploit
        modern hardware and software technologies in their daily
        scientific work.
      - There are a few slides attached to today’s agenda.
  - [3rd School on Open Science Cloud, Bologna, Italy, 16-20 September
    2019](https://agenda.infn.it/event/19049/)
      - The School is multi-disciplinary and targeted at postgraduate
        researchers including bachelor degree or equivalent in fields
        such as physics, statistics, computer science, computer
        vision, biology, medicine, engineering working at any research
        institute, with experience in data analysis, in computing or
        in related fields.
      - The 2019 school’s theme is “Intelligent Systems”. The programme is organized over two tracks:
        - Machine Learning Methods and Applications
        - Computing infrastructures
  - Some ongoing IRIS-HEP meetings focused on analysis are of
    interest:
      - Analysis Systems Meetup:
        [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/822074/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/822074/).
      - BluePrint meeting between the Scalable Systems Laboratory and
        Analysis Systems group:
        [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/820946/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/820946/).

## Google Summer of Code 2019
  - First evaluation due next week.

## Activity and Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis
  - Organizing the next topical meeting:
    - “Comp infrastructures for future data analysis”, July 22nd (announcement will be sent later today).
    - Discuss experience and ideas with different platforms (local
      clusters, powerful individual servers, distributed systems, cloud
      resources etc…).
    - Collect inputs for the pre-CHEP workshop.
    - Would like to collect input from analysts, in particular.

### Detector Simulation
  - HG: Held a topical meeting of the HSF simulation group last week:
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/816485/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/816485/)
    and tools for the Detector Geometry Description. Approximately 20
    people were connected (either in the room or on vidyo). We had
    three talks: VecGeom, Diagnostic Plots and DD4hep and a
    stimulating discussion. We have decided that we will hold our next
    topical meeting after the summer break -- please feel free to
    contact us if you have suggestions for the topics.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
  - Next topical meeting on the week of July 14th
      - In combination with the real-time analysis workshop:
        [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/793125/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/793125/).
      - Topic: persistent trigger objects, talks from
        LHCb/ATLAS/CMS/neutrino community (?).
  - Other action items:
      - Follow up on code optimization meeting that we had two weeks
        ago (LHCb-centric, now involving ATLAS and CMS).

### Software Tools
  - Following up on next topics.

### Training
  - Discussion with ATLAS and ALICE started about having a Software
    Carpentries event at CERN in the autumn, A possible StarterKit
    training as well.

### Event Generators
  - Meeting next week. Several people were at the Les Houches workshop
    this/last week.

### Packaging
  - Next meeting planned for 10 July
    ([<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/829817/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/829817/)).
      - Contact Ben and Graeme for any topics.
      - Summer student has started at CERN working in this area.

### Frameworks
  - Mandate:
    [<span class="underline">https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/frameworks.html</span>](https://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/workinggroups/frameworks.html).
  - Search committee is Liz, Michel and Graeme.
  - So far 10 nominations received, we are chasing up with nominees to
    check that they would be willing to do this.
  - Once that is done, we’ll open up for comments from HSF in general
    (\~2 weeks).

## Workshops

## AOB
  - Calendar:
      - It would be useful to start filling in the calendar for known
        events in 2020.
      - There is a suggestion from the CHEP Diversity Working Group
        that we also track the most important religious holidays, so
        as to avoid clashes with major meetings.
          - There are sites listing this, but it’s hard to know what’s
            most important regarding meeting schedules (by some
            metrics all days are religious holidays somewhere).
          - Generally we think this should be taken into account, but
            not clear how best to tackle the issue.
          - We didn't like the idea of using the main HSF Calendar as this
            mixes two very different things.
          - Keep discussing with CHEP DWG.
  - Mailing List:
      - There were 3 spam messages in the last week (non-HEP job
        postings). The user who sent them has been banned.
      - These are quite rare incidents, so we don’t plan to make
        joining the list an approved action. (One does have to be a
        list member to post.)
  - [<span class="underline">AIDA++ Software
    Meeting</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/822748/) was this
    week:
      - We have a [<span class="underline">number of EoIs in
        preparation</span>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DB_7_OgWJ2EdF_lWjpZxf_oTzC4EdH2h0ZRSGTgbXnc/edit?usp=sharing).
      - Other EoIs are possible, but we do encourage coordination with
        the current software group via Frank and Witek.
