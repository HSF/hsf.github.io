## <span dir="ltr">News, general matters</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">ECFA Presentation Feedback</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">The talk was well received (it’s on
        [<span class="underline">YouTube</span>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-qxvIwGU54&t=13540s)),
        as lot of positive feedback from senior ECFA people.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Discussion focused on C++ (is it still the
        right language for us? can it attract new talent to our field,
        espc. from CompSci?); how to work in wider software
        ecosystems, data analysis and ML; European Open Science Cloud
        for resource delivery (to multiple communities, not just HEP);
        how to manage legacy software and evolve/rewrite for new
        architectures - how do we do this as a community?</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">IRIS Support Letter</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Supporting students to come to CERN for a
        summer.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Not funded last time, but encouraged to
        re-apply this year.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">See attachment in Indico.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Approved.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Google Summer of Code 2019</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Remember to submit your final student evaluations
    by September 2.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Google Season of Docs</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We got one technical writer for ROOT.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Activity and Working Group Updates</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Detector Simulation</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Just restarting now...</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Reconstruction and Software Triggers</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">At the last coordination meeting, we floated the
    idea of involving other communities (dark matter, GW, ) to
    understand what their software needs are and if there are points
    in common</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">We have the chance to do it “live” (+Vidyo) at
        this meeting:
        [<span class="underline">https://jenas-2019.lal.in2p3.fr</span>](https://jenas-2019.lal.in2p3.fr)
        as we could get a room for the Wednesday afternoon after the
        end of the workshop, and it could make sense to do it HSF-wide
        rather than just reco-trigger-wide.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">E.g. we could have a talk by one of the
        members of ESCAPE
        [<span class="underline">https://projectescape.eu</span>](https://projectescape.eu)
        (Elena Cuoco) who is keen to collaborate on tools and wants to
        know more about HSF.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Other ideas? Opinions?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">General HSF overview would be a good
            idea.</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Ask these other communities about their
            challenges.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Is this specifically Reco & Software Trigger?</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">Not exclusively, but it was a
            direct contact with Caterina.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Next reco & sw trigger [meeting on Sept 4th](https://indico.cern.ch/event/835790/), on
    ALICE/LHCb trigger overview.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Software Tools</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Not much activity over the summer, coming back
    online...</span>

    Nov. since earlier dates (16-18 Oct) clash with PyHEP in Abingdon,
    U.K.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Thanksgiving Week, but this is EU
        focused.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Graeme is working on booking rooms at CERN.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Indico (prelim) -
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/834411/).</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Past training events -
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/category/11386/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/category/11386/).</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Recent - USATLAS/FIRST-HEP Computing Bootcamp
    (LBNL) was great success-
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/816946/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/816946/).</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We will ask for tutors to help - about 10 people
    to have a 1:5 ratio.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Frameworks</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Comment period has closed, Michel, Liz and Graeme
    will meet tomorrow.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Licensing</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Should we be progressing on this again? FastJet
    contact attempts seemed to go to `/dev/null`...</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Current software isn’t even thread safe; there
        is some interest in rewriting this from the US side and will
        result in a more open license as it is the US policy.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Graeme, Liz, Michel will have an offline
        discussion on strategy.</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Quantum Computing</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Quantum Future Hackathon at CERN, 18-20 October
    ([<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/838035/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/838035/))</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Software Forum</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">No meeting scheduled yet</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Less need for meetings now that the WGs are active
    and doing a very good job\!</span>

## <span dir="ltr">Workshops</span>

### <span dir="ltr">Pre-CHEP (2-3 November)</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Many people have signed up for this, 130+.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We are investigating having a more interactive
    session on Sunday. This seems like a good idea, but will be
    logistically tricky.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Next planning meeting Tuesday 3 September,
    17h.</span>
<span dir="ltr"></span>

### <span dir="ltr">Latin American Workshop on Software and Computing Challenges in HEP (Mexico, Nov 20-23)</span>
<span dir="ltr"></span>
  - <span dir="ltr">“First Latin American Workshop on Software and
    Computing Challenges in HEP” is confirmed for November 20-23rd in
    Mexico City.
    [<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/813325/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/813325/)</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Goal is for Latin American colleagues
        interested in S&C to partner with each other and with the
        international community (this may improve their funding
        opportunities).</span>
          - <span dir="ltr">This is also an opportunity for PIs in the
            international community to network and partner with Latin
            American institutions.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Registration will open September 1st. Some
        people associated with HSF have already confirmed
        participation (i.e. Sudhir Malik, Gordon Watts). There will
        also be participation of people from FNAL and CERN.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Announcements will be made through HSF lists
        and other avenues sometime next week.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">More members of our international HSF
        community may be contacted by the scientific organizing
        committee to give presentations on the different areas
        described in the Roadmap (i.e. generators, simulation,
        reconstruction, trigger software, distributed computing, data
        management, etc.) Are there volunteers or interested
        parties?</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">One problem to resolve: the science budget
        situation in a few Latin American countries has deteriorated
        significantly in the last few months (you may know if you
        follow the news). Advice from HSF members on how to contact
        potential sponsors (HEP, industry) so that we have funds to
        pay for participants/speakers from Latin America will be
        welcome. A fund of the order of 10-20k would be of great help
        to improve the situation. Any ideas?</span>
        - Will try to contact partners via OpenLab at CERN as one possibility.

### <span dir="ltr">Next HSF/WLCG Workshop</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">4-8 or 11-15 May 2020.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">We anticipate 3 hosting offers from:</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">DESY.</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">Sweden (Lund U and Umea).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">University POLITEHNICA of Bucharest in
        Romania.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Prospective hosts are going to make short
    presentations at the GDB in FNAL, 11 September
    ([<span class="underline">https://indico.fnal.gov/event/21232/</span>](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/21232/)).
    9h30 FNAL time, 16h30 CERN.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Comments can be taken at the GDB and at the HSF
    meeting the next day (12 September). Or email David, Graeme,
    Michel.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">Decision to be taken soon after that by organising
    committee.</span>

## <span dir="ltr">AOB</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">AIDA++ planning Open Meeting next Wednesday (4
    September).</span>
      - <span dir="ltr">[<span class="underline">https://indico.cern.ch/event/838460/</span>](https://indico.cern.ch/event/838460/).</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">No meeting next week (CERN holiday for Jeûne
    genevois), reconvene 12 September.</span>
  - <span dir="ltr">The entry for the weekly meeting in the HSF
    calendar disappeared (oops\!). It’s been recreated.</span>
