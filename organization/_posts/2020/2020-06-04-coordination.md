## News, general matters

### LHCC Referees Meeting

[LHCC referees meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/877841/) yesterday, Graeme presented the software report (thanks for feedback and input)

- Comment on workshop
    - Possible tension between live presentations and ensuring we stick to time (pre-recorded talks don't run over!)
        - Need discipline (chairs and speakers) for the presentation 'core' not to be over time; questions during the talk are fine, indeed part of the perceived advantage of live talks
- Questions on PyHEP
    - How to manage so many participants
        - If CERN Zoom trial is made official >500 people may be possible
    - The participant communities
        - LHC, non-LHC, sites, Belle II, DUNE, dark matter
        - Short discussion use of Python in core of DM experiments (XENON1T)

### Alpaka Training

- Alpaka (heterogeneous API) training will take place as a [virtual event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/912156/)
- Reminder mail to be sent soon on the HSF mailing list (fixing last technical details)
    - Co-organised with SIDIS, openlab, CASUS
- Date settled: June 29 - July 3
    - Monday - Friday, 9.00 - 10.30 CEST

## LHCC Review of HL-LHC Software and Computing

- Review took place 19 May, based on the [HSF input document](https://zenodo.org/record/3779250) and a short presentation
- Still waiting for the written feedback from the referees (general impression was quite positive, but we were asked to wait for the written report before discussing and responding)


## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis
 - Meeting on non-mainstream analysis patterns postponed due to unavailability of speakers from many of the contacted experiments
 - Probably splitting in two sessions (one before summer, one after)
     - Attempted splitting based on topic (e.g. B-physics vs exotics), but does not fit different experiments' timelines

### Detector Simulation
- Topical meeting on 27th May devoted to GPU usage in simulation
    - Three very interesting presentations on successful application of that technology in specific domains (medical, optical photons, neutron transport)
- Next two meetings scheduled for 10th and 24th of June where we invite everybody to contribute with 'lightning talks' on ideas how we could use GPUs in HEP simulation


### Reconstruction and Software Triggers
 - Trying to converge on the next meeting (GPU related)
     - Right now planned for the 10th, but will possibly be moved to get speakers
     - The 10th would be a detector simulation conflict as we type, so one more reason to move :)
 - In the pipeline:
     - GitHub repo for graph networks for tracking
     - Update of webpages with info about projects coming from LHCC report


### PyHEP
- More than 550 registered for the [workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2020), which is proceeding as a virtual workshop on the extended dates July 13-17

### Software Tools and Packaging

 - Quite a lot of recent development in the HSF job monitoring tool, [prmon](https://github.com/HSF/prmon)
     - Adds monitoring of NVIDIA GPUs (percentage SM, GPU memory, number of GPUs)
     - Revisited the code and made many nice architectural improvements and enhancements
- Planning to hold a WG meeting "soon" (time TBD):
    - There are a number of topics to be discussed on the packaging side (Spack etc.)
    - We can also discuss the developments on the prmon side.


### Software Training

- There is [Virtual Pipelines Training](https://indico.cern.ch/event/904759/) this week

### Frameworks

- Nothing to report since the HSF/WLCG virtual meeting
    - Conveners will work to schedule next topical meetings, still likely related to multi-threaded scheduling.
- Was informally asked for input to the upcoming LHCb workshop on heterogeneous computing. Should work that into our schedule...

## Other Interest and Activity Areas

### Visualisation

Presentation on [Phoenix](https://github.com/HSF/phoenix) event display, see [Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/916410/) for slides

- What is the support model?
    - No one funds this beyond GSoC and open source volunteers
- Neutrino experiments mostly make their own displays, could be very useful for the LAr experiments
    - Good contribution model and cheaper than people rewriting again and again from scratch
- Implements many things we wanted to do from the CWP, +1!
    - Geometries are plugins; so could the data stream in (with suitable metadata?), and could then support time dependent geometry
    - Development work, but definitely supported by underlying toolkit (in ATLAS case need to convert from custom geometry to something that can be understood by three.js)

## Workshops

### New Architectures, Portability, and Sustainability

[Indico](https://indico.cern.ch/event/908146/).

Some survey highlights:
- Slides in advance and notebook were liked
- Live talks strongly supported over pre-recorded talks
- Format was about what people wanted (duration, timeslot)
- We should be much more disciplined with time keeping
    - More important for virtual meetings
- Topics covered were supported as is posting videos of the event
    - Maybe we should also post to YouTube?
    - N.B. Indico access stats seem broken (woeful under-reporting)
- People want to see conclusions and outcomes
    - We are in the process of identifying these now
- Large support for continuing with virtual meetings in the future
    - But people want face-to-face meetings as well

Full feedback meeting will be *Wednesday 17 June, 17h CERN time*: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/925974/>

Planning next virtual event, **21-25 September** (so *save the date*).

## AOB

### Next Meeting

- Next regular meeting slot is 18 June
    - We plan to discuss a proposal for a new activity on *differentiable computing* (details will be circulated later)
