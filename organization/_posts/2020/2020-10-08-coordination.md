## News, general matters, announcements

### New Convenor(s) for Data Analysis WG

Yes, we have new convenors...

- Allison Hall (FNAL, CMS)
- Chris Burr (CERN, LHCb)

We welcome them to the group!

### C++ Course

We are all set to go next week:

12-16 October, <https://indico.cern.ch/event/946584/>.

### Compute Accelerator Forum

First meeting was last week: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/950196/>. 60 people attended.

- Booking next topics, please suggestions to Graeme, Stefan and Maria
- Timeslot will move to 16h30 or 17h Wednesdays, which is easier for US West Coast
- For 2021 we move to a regular slot of 4th Wednesday of each month

### Geant4

Pere and Graeme have been having discussions with Marc Verderi and Alberto Ribon (G4 management) about how to improve cooperation between Geant4 and the HSF.

- These have been held in a very constructive spirit so far
- One concrete outcome is the co-organisation of the detector simulation session in the November workshop
- A number of important discussion topics are still ongoing

### Snowmass

- Interesting Snowmass session/whitepapers at the Community Planning Workshop:
  - Collider data analysis strategies: <https://indico.fnal.gov/event/44870/sessions/16380/#20201006>
  - Computational Frontier planning & report organization: <https://indico.fnal.gov/event/44870/sessions/16256/#20201007>
- Daniel is involved as a convenor
- Liz was in the DOMA/facilities discussions

Please report in HSF meetings if you have interesting interactions in the Snowmass process or suggestions for the HSF,

## Working Group Updates

### Detector Simulation

Started planning (together with the Geant4 member) the detector simulation session at the HSF-WLCG workshop. We have first draft of the agenda. We do not foresee topical meetings before that.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

Awakening from hibernation (a ~month hiatus due to other commitments...)

Encouraging people to submit abstracts to the HSF workshop.

Semi-related:

- ESCAPE INFRAEOSC-03 was approved and it's now in "revisions" mode, Dark Matter Test Science Project will have a few postdocs joining HSF activities
- TOOLS2020 conference for (software) tools in HEP and astronomy <https://indico.cern.ch/event/955391/abstracts/>

### PyHEP

- PyHEP 2020 workshop "proceedings":
  - Half the talks and notebook repositories now minted a DOI on Zenodo (<https://zenodo.org/communities/pyhep2020>). Eduardo finalising asap.
- Discussions for future topical WG meetings have started. Possible topics are:
  - Automatic differentiation (something that attracted attention during the PyHEP 2020 workshop).
  - "HEP Statistics Serialization Standard" (think models, RooWorkspace) for RooFit and pyhf, zfit, ... (see [their first meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/event/896473/)).
  - We are unlikely to have more than one WG meeting in 2020 given the significant number of HEP-relevant events throughout the calendar.

### Software Tools and Packaging

- Very useful meeting/tutorial on Modern CMake given by Henry Schreiner:
  - <https://indico.cern.ch/event/956862/>
  - In particular, section on using CMake to build/package Python extensions (scikit-build etc)
- Planning meetings on Spack and Conda (speakers, dates to be determined)

### Software Training

- C++ training next week
- Group planning contribution to the workshop

### Event generators

- Working on HSF/WLCG agenda - close to finalised, will start inviting speakers soon.
- Paper referee comments to be answered - meeting tomorrow among conveners to finalize the answers.
- Snowmass [Advances in Event Generation and Detector Simulation](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/44870/sessions/16258/#20201007) session last night.
  - Interesting discussion on generators, nothing really new came up.
  - Some previously skeptical theorists seemed more on board with the need to migrate code to GPUs.

### Frameworks

- Interesting meeting last week with Frank Berghaus of AthenaMT presenting about ATLAS' metadata handling. - We intend to meet next week (Oct. 14) for a presentation about CMSSW's handling of non-event data. Awaiting confirmation from the speaker.

## Workshops

### HSF-WLCG Virtual November Workshop

Workshop dates fixed 19, 20, 23, 24 November (pm CET).

Indico: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/941278/>.

Registration open 52 people signed up so far - **please sign up yourself**.

Good advertising so far: HSF, Belle II, ATLAS, CMS, LHCb, ALICE (asked), DUNE (asked), Geant4, HSF website updated

**But please help broadcast to other communities as well.**

Had an HSF planning meeting earlier this week. Organisation: Caterina <--> TJ.

Agenda planning is going well:

- Thursday - Software Plenary
  - PyHEP
  - Tools and Packaging (Spack focus)
  - Nuclear Physics summary and discussion
    - This is a follow on from the very successful NP workshop last week
    - Improving cooperation and work on common software was a major discussion there
  - Training
  - Discussion on one more talk
- Friday - Event Generators
  - Will expand the session to 3 hours: either 15-18h or 15.30-18.30h
  - Lots of ideas for talks
    - Contact WG convenors if you have ideas
- Monday - Detector Simulation
  - Lots of ideas for talks
    - Contact WG convenors if you have ideas
- Tuesday - Open Session
  - So far only one abstract submitted
  - A lot of informal interest, so still hope this will be a success
