## News, general matters

### Discussion with CMS

We were invited by Danilo and Markus to give a talk to CMS in a [session on external projects](https://indico.cern.ch/event/902343/) (along with IRIS-HEP and HEP-CCE)
- Outline of the HSF, motivation and history
- Current structure and activities
- Prospects for future collaboration and impact

### Proto-SIDIS

The "[Software Institute for Data Intensive Sciences (SIDIS)](https://sidis.web.cern.ch/)" is an initiative to establish connections and promote common R&D between software engineers in natural sciences and computer science departments at universities, currently focusing on European partners. SIDIS currently is in a conceptualisation phase. 

The activities of SIDIS are regularly discussed on the **third Wednesday of the month, 10.00 - 11.00 CE(S)T**, in the [SIDIS Coordination meeting](https://indico.cern.ch/category/11734/). The meeting usually contains topics to discuss and is public. If you are interested in a specific topic or SIDIS in general please join. 

Current activities of SIDIS are:
- the "Alpaka training and hackathon (see below)" in collaboration with HSF, Openlab and [CASUS](https://www.hzdr.de/db/Cms?pNid=1227&pLang=en)
- a "Topical Workshop on accelerator programming" tentatively to be held in early December with the goals to
    - Draw a landscape of current national initiatives similar to SIDIS and connecting those
    - Exercise the core idea of SIDIS to connect computer scientists and natural scientists, aiming at interactivity as much as possible
    - Establish common R&D activities amongst computer science and natural science

If you are interested in SIDIS please [subscribe to proto-sidis-concept@cern.ch](https://e-groups.cern.ch/e-groups/EgroupsSubscription.do?egroupName=proto-sidis-concept). In case you don't have a CERN account you need to follow some [special instructions to subscribe](https://sidis.web.cern.ch/node/44). Meetings will be also announced on this list.

### Alpaka training event

This has had to be postponed for now. If you are interested please sign up at <https://indico.cern.ch/event/883212/>. We will inform participants when the new date (tentatively end of June) and format have been decided.


## Google Summer of Code 2020

The GSoC timeline has been updated: <https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works/#timeline>

The student application deadline is still March 31, but the student proposal review period is now March 31-April 20. So the new *deadline for finishing the student evaluations is April 16* (instead of April 10), giving us few days to evaluate the number of slots we need to ask.


## LHCC Review of HL-LHC Software and Computing

*Reminder*: LHCC will review software and computing plans for the HL-LHC, Amber Boehnlein (JLab) will chair. Five 20 page documents provided as input to the committee, from ATLAS, CMS, WLCG, DOMA and from *Common Tools and Community Software* (the HSF takes care of the later)

*Latest News*:
- There will be no face to face meeting, there will be a one day virtual meeting instead
- Present each of the 5 documents (20') + discussion (20')
- Participation: review panel, LHCC chair (Frank Simon), 1-2 people per document (about 25)
- 1 May deadline for the documents is maintained
- Foresee one more virtual meeting in the Autumn, a f2f meeting next year in Q2 2021
    - No news yet on how this affects a common software in-depth review in Autumn 2021

[Document outline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ai7m7kFyiGgl2tKralJKyPX6rlD9tffU7B6wPj_vpZU/edit?usp=sharing) has been created and now has a fair amount of material.

*Aim is now to have a reasonable draft by the end of this month, with all sections populated.* This allows for our own review and an alignment with the other documents.

### Introduction

- Some introductory text has been written covering a few topics at high level:
    - Technology Evolution
        - Compute devices and APIs
        - Storage systems
    - Software Tools and Packaging
    - Training
    - Software Distribution (CVMFS)
    - Software Preservation

*Please take a look and decide if we need to expand on any points (but remember the target audience)*

### Event Generators

The draft contribution of the WG has been merged into the full HSF document, although it still needs to receive feedback from all of the WG. Presently 5 pages plus one of references (do others foresee references, too?). This is a shorter version of the draft that was prepared last month, which we plan to complete on the same timescale and upload to arXiv (or submit to a journal).

### Detector Simulation
Draft of the simulation chapter for LHCC review completed and merged into the full HSF document.

### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

Were drafting text in a different document - can now move this into the main document. Contacted more trigger & reco common efforts, most of them have replied / have promised to reply. 


### Data Analysis

Draft added before last meeting, not substantially changed, but a few spots will require further input, notably:
* Discussion of new analysis tools (including PyHep, ROOT developments) to be expanded
* Prospects/R&D section will be updated with information gathered from meetings this Spring including DAWG-DOMA discussions (see below)
* Fact-checking, references, numbers...

### HSF Feedback Process

**Discussion [with CMS](https://indico.cern.ch/event/902139/)** happened on Tuesday 24, points that came up were:

- Is there an overall plan and priority?
    - No and we did not expect to have one at this stage
    - Prioritisation can happen on a profiled basis (invest more in the more expensive areas); *however every experiment is at a different working point, so no one-size-fits-all recommendation*
- HSF should comment on the performance of generators, not on the decisions of the experiments
    - Indeed, but comparison of ATLAS and CMS led to significant insights in this area; it is not a competitive or pejorative comparison - this was the spirit of the study, which was led by ATLAS and CMS generator experts
- WLCG does not foresee 'analysis facilities' being distinguished at the resource accounting level (they stick to the Tier 0/1/2 model)
    - ALICE plans are more for a reduction facility
    - (Graeme personal comment) true analysis facilities are very much at the R&D stage

**Further Feedback**

- Make public release of document at the *beginning of next week* (probably needs some tidying)
    - Commentable in Google Docs
    - WGs can update and resolve comments as they come in; flag up controversial points
- Organise one longer feedback meeting, but also decide in advance what topics need discussion time
- **Proposal:** HSF review and feedback Thursday 16 April, 15-17h
    - In the coordination slot, but out of phase (we know this time is reasonably free from clashes)


## Working Group Updates

### Data Analysis

- Very interesting discussions in the joint meeting with WLCG-DOMA: <https://indico.cern.ch/event/890991/>
    - Would be useful to define benchmarks and inject realism into tests -> will followup (homework for the convenors)
    - Emphasis (rightly) on the streamlined reduction model (nanoAOD, PHYS_LITE), but we need to consider the "10%" that can't fit into that model
    - How will exclusive analysis (e.g. LHCb, Belle II) work, similar?  Or would ServiceX be an even better fit there?
- Analysis language workshop is postponed, hope is still to have a face to face meeting but in "wait and see" mode

### Detector Simulation
Topical [meeting 25th of March 2020](https://indico.cern.ch/event/899153/) focused on non-LHC experiments. One talk from neutrino experiments (NOvA, SBN and DUNE) and one from Belle II. Neutrino community would appreciate a lot having a GPU-based module for optical photons transport that could be integrated into Geant4, as this currently is a very CPU-consuming part of the simulation.

Next topical meeting to be decided, but target is end April, beginning May.


### Reconstruction and Software Triggers

Next meeting confirmed for April 1st 17-18h, ATLAS/CMS CPU optimization experiences in reconstruction code. In calendar, will be announced today. 

General HSF question: we had a researcher contacting us to do some hands-on work in the WG. We think this is great! We could go two ways:
- give him the set of projects and putting him in touch with the one that matches his interest
- ask him to help out with making one of the projects more cross-collaboration
- other opinions... 

Opinions on what's best for HSF? 
- In general this is very positive; we are very keen on work that *generalises software to a larger community*, but do need to check that the projects themselves are amenable is important

### Software Tools and Packaging

- In case people have missed it, you can access the agenda for the OpenLAB/Intel remote session on oneAPI [here](https://indico.cern.ch/event/878418/timetable/?view=standard):
    - Material is available for future reference.
    - In particular, _Offload Advisor_ (What should I offload to a GPU?) looks like an interesting tool that we can discuss in one of the upcoming meetings. If you have any experience w/ it (especially in a real-life example) please get in touch w/ us.
    - Majority of the session was dedicated to DPC++.

- From Ben: "[...] collect a list of packages we need in Spack, but not currently there. I've got a feeling there are several efforts out there writing their own recipes, but in either case it could be good to get this in place."
    - To be followed up possibly via e-mail and/or a meeting.
    - LCG release contents would be a good starting point

### Event generators

- Development on GPU port of MG5aMC is progressing. Planning a meeting on Monday including CERN, Louvain and Argonne contributors.

### Frameworks

We have scheduled a meeting for next week (April 1) to discuss the JANA framework's multi-threaded scheduling mechanisms.  This inaugurates a series of meetings devoted toward exploring how different experiments handle the scheduling of steps to be performed in a multi-threaded environments.

## Workshops

### HSF/WLCG 2020 workshop

For a re-scheduled full workshop **21-25 September is the proposal being discussed**

- We have pre-booked the same venue in Lund (social dinner moved to Tuesday as there are more takers for Fall conferences)
- No one knows how the situation will evolve, so more news will come before the summer

#### Virtual Event Proposal

The Scientific Organising Team continued discussing what we could do as a virtual event in the May slot

Current proposal to organise a *3* session event, focused on **New Architectures, Portability, and Sustainability** (i.e. the Tuesday Lund plenary session), but to have these three sessions spread over 3 days and *only for 2 hours* (roughly the time we feel that people can concentrate on remote hosted events)
- Monday 11, Tuesday 12 and Wednesday 13; 16-18h CERN time (fairly friendly from Europe to the N American Pacific coast)
    - Day 1 - Code portability, Common software
    - Day 2 - Workflows (Framework, WMS)
    - Day 3 - Validation, Pledges, Benchmarking
- We would like speakers to upload their material *well* in advance.
- Have a notes document where people can post questions, also in advance.
- Almost certainly we would use Zoom which has some nice features for larger meetings.
- Setup a semi-permanent chat channel (not just VC chat), like Slack or Mattermost.
- [discussion needed] material can be indexed on Zenodo, including recordings
    - Practically, use Indico to get recording permission
    - Not planning to pre-record talks, but to have material still presented during the event

*This would be a learning experience for the community, that could lead the way towards less travel and f2f meetings as well as keeping activities running in times of COVID-19.*

- **Is this worthwhile doing?** Please *do* give feedback on whether you believe this event is good to organise and if you would attend it (in particular, if your feelings are *negative*)
    - Liz - virtual meetings need to have a specific focus, but experience of virtual CMS S&C week is positive
    - David - *Connecting the Dots* will be pre-recording material (otherwise not practical to do 20hrs of material from many timezones), so this will provide some experience of an alternative format

### [PyHEP 2020 Workshop](http://indico.cern.ch/e/PyHEP2020)
- We will decide on the format of PyHEP 2020 next week.
- In touch with SciPy 2020 conference chairs for what happens there.

## AOB

We changed to Zoom this week, a regular meeting has been booked until the end of the year
- Please give [feedback on your Zoom experience](https://espace.cern.ch/AVC-workspace/videoconference/Lists/Zoom%20Pilot%20Feedback/overview.aspx) to CERN IT

### Next Meeting

- Next regular meeting slot is 9 April
